    "content": "<p>In traditional grammar, <strong>word</strong> is the basic unit of language. <strong>Words</strong> can be classified according to their action and meaning, but it is challenging to define.&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>word</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>refers to a&nbsp;speech&nbsp;sound, or a mixture of two or more speech sounds in both written and verbal form of language. A <strong>word</strong> works as a symbol to represent/refer to something/someone in language to communicate a specific&nbsp;meaning.</p><p><strong>Example</strong> : &lsquo;love&rsquo;, &lsquo;cricket&rsquo;, &lsquo;sky&rsquo; etc.</p><blockquote>'[A word is the] smallest unit of&nbsp;grammar&nbsp;that can stand alone as a complete&nbsp;utterance, separated by spaces in written&nbsp;language&nbsp;and potentially by pauses in speech.'<span class='r'> (David Crystal,&nbsp;<em>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language</em>. Cambridge University Press, 2003)</span></blockquote><p><em>Morphology, </em>a branch of linguistics, studies the formation of words. The branch of linguistics that studies the meaning of <strong>words</strong> is called&nbsp;<em>lexical&nbsp;semantics</em>.</p><p>There are several criteria for a speech sound, or a combination of some speech sounds to be called a <strong>word</strong>.</p><ul><li>There must be a<strong> potential pause </strong>in speech and a <strong>space</strong> in written form between two words. <br /><strong>For instance</strong>, suppose &lsquo;ball&rsquo; and &lsquo;bat&rsquo; are two different words. So, if we use them in a sentence, we must have a potential pause after pronouncing each of them. It cannot be like &ldquo;Idonotplaywithbatball.&rdquo; If we take pause, these sounds can be regarded as seven distinct words which are &lsquo;I,' &lsquo;do,' &lsquo;not,' &lsquo;play,' &lsquo;with,' &lsquo;bat,' and &lsquo;ball.'</li><li>Every word must contain at least <strong>one root</strong>. If you break this root, it cannot be a word anymore. <br /><strong>For example</strong>, the word &lsquo;unfaithful&rsquo; has a root &lsquo;faith.' If we break &lsquo;faith&rsquo; into &lsquo;fa&rsquo; and &lsquo;ith,' these sounds will not be regarded as words.</li><li>Every word must have a meaning. <br /><strong>For example</strong>, the sound &lsquo;lakkanah&rsquo; has no meaning in the English language. So, it cannot be an English word.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>"

Instead of writing/saying &lsquo;a food cooked in Chinese recipe&rsquo; you can write/say &lsquo;Chinese food&rsquo;.</p><p>Proper adjectives are usually capitalized as proper nouns are.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>American</span> cars are very strong.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Chinese</span> people are hard workers.</li><li>I love <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>KFC</span> chicken. </li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Marxist</span> philosophers despise capitalism.</li></ul><h3 id='demonstrative'>Demonstrative Adjectives:</h3><p>A&nbsp;<strong>demonstrative adjective</strong>&nbsp;directly refers to something or someone. Demonstrative adjectives include the words: <em>this, that, these, those</em>.</p><p>A&nbsp;demonstrative pronoun works alone and does not precede a noun, but a demonstrative adjective always comes before the word it modifies.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>That</span> building is so gorgeously decorated. (&lsquo;That&rsquo; refers to a singular noun far from the speaker)</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>This</span> car is mine. (&lsquo;This&rsquo; refers to a singular noun close to the speaker)</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>These</span> cats are cute. (&lsquo;These&rsquo; refers to a plural noun close to the speaker)</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Those</span> flowers are heavenly. (&lsquo;Those&rsquo; refers to a plural noun far from the speaker)</li></ul><h3 id='possessive'>Possessive Adjectives:</h3><p>A <strong>possessive adjective</strong>&nbsp;indicates&nbsp;possession or ownership. It suggests the belongingness of something to someone/something.</p><p>Some of the most used possessive adjectives are <em>my, his, her, our, their, your.&nbsp; </em></p><p>All these adjectives always come before a noun. Unlike possessive pronouns, these words demand a noun after them.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>My</span> car is parked outside.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>His</span> cat is very cute.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Our</span> job is almost done.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Her</span> books are interesting.</li></ul><h3 id='interrogative'>Interrogative Adjectives:</h3><p>An <strong>interrogative adjective</strong>&nbsp;asks a question. An interrogative adjective must be followed by a noun or a pronoun. The interrogative adjectives are: <em>which, what, whose. </em>These words will not be considered as adjectives if a noun does not follow right after them. &lsquo;<em>Whose&rsquo; </em>also belongs to the possessive adjective type.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Which</span> phone do you use?</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>What</span> game do you want to play?</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Whose</span> car is this?</li></ul><h3 id='indefinite'>Indefinite Adjectives:</h3><p>An <strong>indefinite adjective</strong> describes or modifies a noun unspecifically. They provide indefinite/unspecific information about the noun. The common indefinite adjectives are <em>few, many, much, most, all</em><em>, any, each, every, either, nobody, several, some,</em> etc. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li>I gave <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>some</span> candy to her.</li><li>I want <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>a few</span> moments alone.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Several</span> writers wrote about the recent incidents.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Each</span> student will have to submit homework tomorrow.</li></ul><h3 id='articles'>Articles</h3><p><strong>Articles</strong> also modify the nouns. So, articles are also adjectives. Articles determine the specification of nouns. &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;an&rsquo; are used to refer to an unspecific noun, and &lsquo;the&rsquo; is used to refer to a specific noun.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>A</span> cat is always afraid of water. (Here, the noun &lsquo;cat&rsquo; refers to any cat, not specific.)</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>The</span> cat is afraid of me. (This cat is a specific cat.)</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>An</span> electronic product should always be handled with care.</li></ul><h3 id='compound'>Compound Adjectives:</h3><p>When compound nouns/combined words modify other nouns, they become a compound adjective. This type of adjective usually combines more than one word into a single lexical unit and modifies a noun. They are often separated by a hyphen or joined together by a quotation mark. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>I have a <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>broken-down</span> bat.</li><li>I saw a <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>six-foot-long</span> snake.</li><li>He gave me an <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>&ldquo;</span><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>I&rsquo;m gonna kill you now&rdquo;</span> look.</li></ul><h3 id='degreeofadjective'>The Degree of Adjectives:</h3><p>There are three degrees of adjectives: <em>Positive, comparative, superlative. </em></p><p>These degrees are applicable only for the descriptive adjectives.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><p><strong>Positive degree: </strong>He is a <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>good</span> boy.</p><p><strong>Comparative degree: </strong>He is <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>better</span> than any other boy.</p><p><strong>Superlative: </strong>He is the <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>best</span> boy.</p>"

It&nbsp;is a form of a&nbsp;verb&nbsp;that is performed by or refers to a&nbsp;subject&nbsp;and uses one of the twelve forms of&nbsp;tense and changes according to the number/person of the subject.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Alex <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>went</span> to school. (Subject &ndash; Alex &ndash; performed the action in the past. This information is evident only by the verb &lsquo;went&rsquo;.)</li><li>Robert <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>plays</span> hockey.</li><li>He <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>is playing</span> for Australia.</li><li>He <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>is</span> one of the best players. (Here, the verb &lsquo;is&rsquo; directly refers to the subject itself.)</li></ul><h3 id='non-finite'>Non-finite Verbs:</h3><p><strong>Non-finite Verbs </strong>are not actual verbs. They do not work as verbs in the sentence rather they work as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Non-finite verbs do not change according to the number/person of the subject because these verbs, also called <strong>verbals</strong>, do not have any direct relation to the subject. Sometimes they become the subject themselves.</p><p>The forms of non-finite verbs are &ndash; infinitive, gerund, and participle (participles become finite verbs when they take auxiliary verbs.)</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Alex went abroad <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>to play</span> (Infinitives)</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Playing</span> cricket is his only job. (Present participle)</li><li>I have a <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>broken</span> cycle. (Past participle)</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Walking</span> is a good habit. (Gerund)</li></ul><h3 id='action'>Action Verbs:</h3><p><strong>Action verbs</strong> indicate what the subject of a sentence performs. Action verbs can make the listener/reader feel emotions, see scenes more vividly and accurately.</p><p>Action verbs can be <em>transitive</em> or <em>intransitive</em>.</p><p><strong>Transitive verbs </strong>must have a direct object. A transitive verb demands something/someone to be acted upon.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>I <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>painted</span> the car. (The verb &lsquo;paint&rsquo; demands an object to be painted)</li><li>She <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>is reading</span> the newspaper. (The verb &lsquo;read&rsquo; asks the question &ldquo;what is she reading?&rdquo; &ndash; the answer is the object)</li></ul><p><strong>Intransitive verbs</strong> do not act upon anything. They may be followed by an adjective, adverb, preposition, or another part of speech.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>She <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>smiled</span>. (The verb &lsquo;smile&rsquo; cannot have any object since the action of &lsquo;smiling&rsquo; does not fall upon anything/anyone)</li><li>I <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>wake</span> up at 6 AM. (No object is needed for this verb)</li></ul><p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> {Subject + Intransitive verb} is sufficient to make a complete sentence but {Subject + Transitive verb} is not sufficient because transitive verbs demand a direct object.</p><h3 id='linking'>Linking Verb:</h3><p><strong>A </strong><strong>linking verb</strong> adds details about the subject of a sentence. In its simplest form, it connects the subject and the complement &mdash; that is, the words that follow the linking verb. It creates a link between them instead of showing action.</p><p>Often, what is on each side of a linking verb is equivalent; the complement redefines or restates the subject.</p><p>Generally, linking verbs are called &lsquo;<strong><em>be&rsquo; verbs </em></strong>which are - <em>am, is, are, was, were</em>. However, there are some other verbs which can work as linking verbs. Those verbs are:</p><p><em>Act, feel, remain,</em> <em>appear, become,</em><em> seem, smell, sound, grow, look, prove, stay, taste, turn.</em></p><p>Some verbs in this list can also be action verbs. To figure out if they are linking verbs, you should try replacing them with forms of the<em> be verbs</em>. If the changed sentence makes sense, that verb is a linking verb.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>She <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>appears</span> ready for the game. (She <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>is</span> ready for the game.)</li><li>The food <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>seemed</span> delicious. (The food <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>was</span> delicious.)</li><li>You <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>look</span> happy. (You <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>are</span> happy.)</li></ul><h3 id='auxiliary'>Auxiliary Verbs:</h3><p>Auxiliary verbs are also called<strong> <em>helping verbs</em></strong>. An <strong>auxiliary verb</strong> extends the main verb by helping to show time, tense, and possibility. The auxiliary verbs are &ndash; <em>be verbs</em><em>, have</em>, and <em>do</em>.</p><p>They are used in the continuous (progressive) and perfect tenses.</p><p>Linking verbs work as main verbs in the sentence, but auxiliary verbs help main verbs.</p><p><em>Do</em> is an auxiliary verb that is used to ask questions, to express negation, to provide emphasis, and more.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Alex <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>is</span> going to school.</li><li>They <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>are</span> walking in the park.</li><li>I <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>have</span> seen a movie.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Do</span> you drink tea?</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Don&rsquo;t</span> waste your time.</li><li>Please, <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>do</span> submit your assignments.</li></ul><h3 id='modal'>Modal Verbs:</h3><p>A <strong>modal verb</strong> is a kind of an auxiliary verb. It assists the main verb to indicate possibility, potentiality, ability, permission, expectation, and obligation.</p><p>The modal verbs are <em>can, could,</em> <em>must, may, might,</em><em> ought to, shall, </em><em>should, will, would. </em></p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>I <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>may</span> want to talk to you again.</li><li>They <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>must</span> play their best game to win.</li><li>She <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>should</span> call him.</li><li>I <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>will</span> go there.</li></ul>"

    "content": "<p>An <strong>interjection</strong> is a kind of exclamation inserted into regular speech. Actually, it is a brief and abrupt pause in speech for expressing emotions.</p><p><strong>Interjections</strong> are unique and have some interesting features:</p><ul><li>Interjections don&rsquo;t have a grammatical function in the sentence construction.</li><li>They usually cannot be modified or inflected.</li><li>They do not have to have a relation to the other parts of the sentence.</li><li>They are highly context-sensitive.</li></ul><p>In spoken language, interjections are the words we instantly use to show our reaction to something which influences our emotion. They are the initial reaction and sometimes do not even make sense. However, for formal speech or writing, using interjections is not appropriate.</p><h3><strong>Interjections mainly have four roles: </strong></h3><p><strong>Rule 1: </strong>Interjections express sudden mood, emotions, and feeling with emphasis. There are also many taboo words that are usually used in everyday conversation but not in formal aspects. These words fall into the category of interjections.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Wow!</span> That&rsquo;s an amazing scene.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Aw</span>, I did not want him to come.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>What?</span> You never told me that!</li></ul><p><strong>Rule 2: </strong>Some interjections interrupt a conversation or a thought or hold someone&rsquo;s attention for a moment. These are just sounds, not words because these sounds do not make any sense.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Your, <em><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>um</span></em>, shirt has a stain on the back.</li><li>I want to, <em><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>uh</span></em>, ask you out on a date.</li></ul><p><strong>Rule 3: </strong>Some interjections express only yes or no.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Yes!</span> I will most definitely do it.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Nah</span>, we are not going.</li></ul><p><strong>Rule 4: </strong>Some interjections are used to get someone&rsquo;s attention.</p><p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Yo</span></em>, Alex! Get in the car!</li><li><em><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Hey!</span></em> Will you give me that ball?</li><li><em><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Yoo-hoo!</span></em> Is there anyone?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"

But a plural common noun does not require an article always. A plural common noun can have the article &lsquo;the&rsquo; if we want to particularise that noun.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>I saw <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>a</span> snake. (Refers to a random snake)</li><li>I saw snakes in a zoo. (No article is required)</li><li>I have seen the snake again. (Refers to the snake I have already seen earlier)</li><li>I have seen the snakes again before leaving the zoo. (Refers to the particular snakes of the zoo which I saw earlier.)</li></ul><p><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule 2:</span></strong></p><p>The choice between the two indefinite articles &ndash; <em>a &amp; an</em> &ndash; is determined by sound. Words beginning with consonant sounds precede &lsquo;<em>a&rsquo;</em> and words beginning with vowel sounds precede &lsquo;<em>an&rsquo;</em>. There are some special cases also. For instance,</p><ul><li>a university, a union, a useful book, etc.</li><li>a one-dollar note, a one-man army, etc.</li><li>an MA, a BA, an LLB, a BSC, etc.</li></ul><p><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule 3:</span></strong></p><p><em>A or an - </em>sometimes makes a&nbsp;Proper Noun&nbsp;a Common Noun. Proper nouns generally do not take any articles, but when a proper noun needs to be used as a common noun, you must bring <em>a or an - </em>for it. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example:&nbsp; </strong></p><ul><li>He thinks he is a Shakespeare. (Here, &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; does not refer to the actual person but someone like him.)</li><li>He seems to be an Australian. (&lsquo;Australia&rsquo; is a proper noun but &lsquo;Australian&rsquo; is a common noun because there is only one Australia but a million of Australians.)</li></ul><p><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule 4:</span></strong></p><p>Sometimes indefinite articles are used to refer the number &lsquo;one&rsquo;/&rsquo;each&rsquo;/&rsquo;per&rsquo;.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>I earned a thousand dollar in that job. (One thousand dollar)</li><li>I have a car. (One car)</li><li>It goes 50 miles an hour. (Per Hour)</li></ul><p><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule 5:</span></strong></p><p>Indefinite articles often precede descriptive adjectives.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>He is a good boy.</li><li>What a nice car!</li></ul><p><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule 6:</span></strong></p><p><em>&lsquo;A&rsquo;</em> sometimes comes before&nbsp;determiners, for example, &nbsp;a <em>few, a little, a lot of, a most, etc. </em>but in the case of <em>many, a or an - </em>comes after<em>. </em></p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>I have a few friends coming over.</li><li>There is a little milk in the jar.</li><li>Many a fan welcomed</li></ul><h3 id='usedefarticle'>Using Definite Article: <em>the</em></h3><p><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule 1:</span></strong></p><p><em>&lsquo;The&rsquo;</em> is used to indicate a particular person(s) or thing(s) in the case of common nouns. Proper nouns generally do not take an article.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>The man is running. (A particular man)</li><li>I saw the boy stealing.</li><li>Where is the pen I gave you last year?</li><li>I gave him a ball, but he lost the ball. (&lsquo;a ball&rsquo; became &lsquo;the ball&rsquo; in the second clause because that ball was not a random ball anymore.)</li></ul><p><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule 2:</span></strong></p><p>Sometimes &lsquo;<em>the&rsquo; </em>is used to generalize a group/whole class.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>The dog is a faithful animal. (Refers to the whole species of dog.)</li><li>The English are industrious. (Refers to the people of England as a nation)</li><li>The honest are respected. (The+adjectives = plural noun)</li><li>The poor are not always dishonest.

The<strong><em> right form</em></strong><strong><em> of verb</em></strong> encompasses most of the grammatical rules of English language. Every element of a sentence eventually relates to the verb.

See the rules of Subject-Verb Agreement.</p><h3>Rule 2:</h3><p>The variability of the verbs mostly depends on different tenses of the sentences. A form of verbs depends on the time the actions have been performed. See the structures and details of The Present Tense, The Past Tense, and The Future Tense.</p><h3>Rule 3:</h3><p>The verbs are also related to the structures of different sentences and clauses. <strong>A&nbsp;clause has only one verb</strong>. In fact, a clause cannot contain more than one finite verb but can have participles (without auxiliaries), infinitives, and gerunds.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>I <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>wanted <sup>(main verb)</sup></span> <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>to go <sup>(infinitive)</sup></span> to the wedding.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Swimming</span><sup>(gerund)</sup> <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>is</span><sup>(verb)</sup> a good exercise <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>to keep </span><sup>(infinitive)</sup> your body fit and healthy.</li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Pray </span><sup>(verb)</sup> for the <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>departed <sup>(past participle)</sup></span></li><li><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Don&rsquo;t get<sup>(verb)</sup></span> down from a <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>running <sup>(present participle)</sup></span></li></ul><h3>Rule 4:</h3><p>Clauses can be connected by conjunctions and connectors. Some connectors take some specific forms of verbs. Conditionals use the conjunction <strong><em>if</em></strong> and it has some different sentence structures. See conditionals.</p><h3>Rule 5:</h3><p>The connector <strong><em>since</em></strong> has two usages.</p><ol><li>If <strong><em>since</em></strong> is used to indicate a cause, the verbs of the two clauses will be of the same tense.</li></ol><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>I didn&rsquo;t go since you didn&rsquo;t come.</li><li>Since you were busy, I didn&rsquo;t disturb you.</li></ul><ol start='2'><li>If since is used to indicate time, the verb of the second clause will be different from the first.</li></ol><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>We <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>haven&rsquo;t seen</span><sup>(present perfect)</sup> each other since he <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>left</span><sup>(simple past)</sup>.</li><li>It <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>has been</span> 20 years since he <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>played</span> chess.</li><li>20 years <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>passed</span><sup>(simple past)</sup> since we <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>had met</span><sup>(past perfect)</sup>.</li><li>I <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>could not sleep</span> well for a single night since you <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>had left</span></li></ul><h3>Rule 6:</h3><p><strong><em>No sooner had, hardly had, scarcely had</em></strong>, etc. are the adverbials that require a past perfect tense and a past indefinite tense for the sentence.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>No sooner had I reached home than she left.</li><li>Scarcely had the police reached when the man died.</li><li>Hardly had I finished writing before the teacher ordered to stop writing.</li></ul><h3>Rule 7:</h3><p><strong>Coordinating conjunctions </strong>(<em>and, but, or, yet, so</em>) and <strong><em>although/though, as, because, till/until, when, whenever, as soon as, while, which, what, that,</em></strong> etc. connect two clauses which have the verbs of the same tense.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>We went to London when we were young.</li><li>I got up, and he left the room.</li><li>As soon as I came here, he greeted me.</li><li>I could not go there because I was sick.</li></ul><h3>Rule 8:</h3><p>As conjunctions <strong><em>after</em></strong> and <strong><em>before</em></strong> are used to connect two clauses which use past perfect tense and past simple. The past perfect tense always comes with a clause of simple past tense.

    "content": "<p>There was no punctuation in any languages of ancient times. With the advancement of civilization, punctuation was introduced in the written form of the language to help a reader distinguish words and ideas from each other and to mirror the natural rhythms of the spoken language. This article will cover proper usage of some of the basic punctuations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>End Marks: Period, Note of Interrogation, Note of Exclamation</strong></p><h2>Period (.)</h2><p><strong>The period</strong> is also called <em>full stop</em> in England. A period declares the end of a sentence. It also indicates the separation of sentences so that the readers cannot mix up different sentences. A period is used at the end of a sentence which is complete and not a question or an exclamatory sentence.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><p>Alex was a little boy when he first saw a person dying<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>.</span> He was so shocked and panicked that he could not sleep for several days<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>.</span>&nbsp; He still fears the sight of someone&rsquo;s death<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>.</span></p><p><strong>The period</strong> is also used in <em>abbreviations</em>.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Saint = St.</li><li>Exempli gratia = e.g.</li><li>Nota bene = N.B.</li></ul><h2>Note of Interrogation (Question Mark) (?)</h2><p>The <strong>note of interrogation</strong> is used to complete sentences that form a direct question. Indirect questions are regarded as statements, and they take <strong>periods</strong>, not question marks.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Have you had your breakfast<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>?</span></li><li>Where are you going<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>?</span></li><li>I don&rsquo;t know where he is going. (A statement, not a direct question)</li></ul><p>Do you know he was watching TV all day long while I was cleaning the house for the party that we want to throw on this weekend<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>?</span>&nbsp; (It&rsquo;s a long sentence, yet it is a direct question.)</p><p>Did you once think about your family<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>?</span> Your career<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>?</span> Your future<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>?</span> Your life<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>?</span> (Series of questions using the same subject and verb)</p><p><strong>Note: </strong></p><p>What? &ndash; So? &ndash; Right? (Single word questions are used only in informal writing.)</p><h2>Note of Exclamation (Exclamation mark/point) (!)</h2><p>The <strong>note of exclamation</strong> indicates excitement, either positive or negative. It can also be used for giving additional emphasis to sentences, phrases, or single words, and especially to commands and interjections.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Wait<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>!</span> Don&rsquo;t take another step<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>!</span></li><li>I can&rsquo;t believe she could say that<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>!</span></li><li>What a gorgeous house<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>!</span></li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>It is best to avoid using a note of exclamation whenever the excitement can be described in words. You should be meticulous in using this punctuation in any form of writing.</p><h2>Comma (,)</h2><p>The <strong>comma</strong> is the most useful and common punctuation mark in English. It has many important roles in making a written form of English easy to read.</p><p>Commas usually add breathing scope for the readers in sentences, so that their thoughts cannot get all jumbled up. A comma has many uses.</p><p><strong>i. Comma between Independent Clauses</strong></p><p>Usually, a comma separates two independent clauses when they are connected by certain coordinating conjunctions&nbsp;(<em>and, but, or, nor, </em>or <em>for</em>). However, if the clauses are very short, no comma is needed.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>They finished dinner in pin-drop silence<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> but Alex knew that he would have to apologize.</li><li>I wanted to watch a movie after dinner<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> but I could not tell her as I was confused about her reactions.</li><li>We had dinner and then I watched a movie. (No comma is needed between these clauses)</li></ul><p><strong>ii. Comma after Introductory Clauses, Phrases, and Expression</strong></p><p>Commas are used not only between independent clauses but also after introductory clauses and phrases. Some expressions and connectors which are placed at the beginning of a sentence also require a comma after them.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>If you take off your jacket<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> you&rsquo;ll catch a cold. (If the subordinators are used at the beginning of the sentences, the <strong>comma</strong> marks the separation of the two clauses)</li><li>Being insulted<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> the piper went to the hill. (Participial phrases are always separated from the clauses by commas.)</li><li>Before start riding it<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> you should read the instructions.</li><li>When you came here<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> Alex was the general manager.</li><li>Well<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> I cannot play in the next match.</li><li>However<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> Alex will play in the next match.</li><li>In winter we usually stay at home most of the time. (Short phrases like &ldquo;in winter&rdquo; don&rsquo;t need commas.)</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>A good way to clear the confusion about commas is to read the sentence aloud to make sure whether there is enough pause taken or not for using a comma.</p><p><strong>iii. Series Comma</strong></p><p>Commas are used to separate multiple items of the same category in a series. These items can be a series of words<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> phrases<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> or clauses.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>We brought pizzas, burgers, chocolate, and a chocolate cake on tour.</li><li>The batsman set up his pads, put on his helmet, and played a good knock. (verb phrases)</li><li>He is a player, a singer, an actor, and a director.</li></ul><p><strong>iv. Comma before Tag Question </strong></p><p>Commas are used before a <em>tag question</em> which is usually a reassuring statement of a sentence&rsquo;s overall idea.</p><ul><li>They&rsquo;re ready to go<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> aren&rsquo;t they?</li><li>They&rsquo;ll never do it<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> will they?</li><li>He loves you<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> doesn&rsquo;t he?</li></ul><p><strong>v. Comma in Direct Address</strong></p><p>Commas are used in <em>vocative</em> uses. Calling someone by name or directly referring to them requires separation by commas.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Hey, Joe, what are you doing?</li><li>Listen, Lee, you have to bowl well today.</li><li>You know, kid, when I was your age, I used to go out a lot.</li></ul><p><strong>vi. Comma for Adding Nonessential Ideas and Nonrestrictive Clauses</strong></p><p>Commas can be used to add nonessential ideas or facts in the form of words, phrases, or clauses into a sentence. Usually removing these ideas from sentences does not affect the grammatical accuracy of the sentences.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>There&rsquo;s a palace in London, just across the river, where I visited last week.</li><li>The new player, you know him, scored a brilliant century.</li><li>I suggest if that&rsquo;s okay, that you let him go.</li></ul><p><strong>vii. Commas in Names and Dates</strong></p><p>Commas are used to separate names of places and dates.</p><p><strong>Example:&nbsp; </strong></p><ul><li>Jefferson City, Missouri, is one of the biggest cities in the world.</li><li>Brisbane, Queensland, is a big city.</li><li>They were married April 05, 2013, in Melbourne. (No comma is necessary only for month and day &ndash; g., they were married on April 5 in Melbourne.)</li><li>He was born June 24, 1993, in London.</li></ul><p><strong>viii. Commas in Dialog</strong></p><p>Commas are used in the dialog to set off the&nbsp;indirect speech from the direct speech.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>I told him<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go there!&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;When we were going there<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span>&rdquo; she said<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> &ldquo;we saw thousands of palm trees.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Please, give me that ball&rdquo;<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> said the boy.</li></ul><h3>Common Mistakes with Commas</h3><p>1. Commas do not separate two verbs or verb phrases joined by a coordinator.</p><p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> I cleaned, and painted the box.</p><p><strong>Correct:</strong> I cleaned and painted the box.</p><p>2. Commas do not separate two nouns, noun phrases, or noun clauses which are joined by a conjunction.</p><p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> My coach, and our board president both sent letters.</p><p><strong>Correct:</strong> My coach and our board president both sent letters.</p><p>3. Subordinate clauses do not need commas when they are joined by a conjunction between them.</p><p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be late if you don&rsquo;t let me go now.</p><p><strong>Correct:</strong> I&rsquo;ll be late if you don&rsquo;t let me go now. (If you don&rsquo;t let me go now<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>,</span> I&rsquo;ll be late.)</p><h2>Colon (:)</h2><p><strong>Colons</strong> are the least used punctuation mark. The usage of colons is limited. Yet, if you know how to use them, you will be able to use them in your writing.</p><p><strong>i.</strong> Colons are used in the salutations of formal letters.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Dear Sir<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>:</span></li><li>To whom it may concern<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>:</span></li><li>To all members:</li></ul><p><strong>ii.</strong> Colons sometimes introduce a series/list to describe some new information after a complete sentence.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The fruit seller had: bananas, apples, and oranges.</p><p><strong>Correct:</strong> The fruit seller had three kinds of fruit: bananas, apples, and oranges.</p><p><strong>iii.&nbsp;</strong>A colon is also used to connect two independent clauses where the first one explains the second clause or logically follows it. The first word after a colon usually is not capitalized unless the colon introduces a series of new sentences or independent clauses.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>He was just thinking only one thing: what was his dog doing then?</li><li>I knew the clue: you just had to read it in the mirror.</li></ul><p><strong>iv.</strong> Colons are used for expressing TIME in figures.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>1:30 AM (Not o'clock)</li><li>7:35 PM</li><li>6:30 in the morning</li></ul><h2><strong>Semicolon (;)</strong></h2><p><strong>Semicolons</strong> are almost like periods, but they connect two&nbsp;independent clauses or sentences together instead of using a coordinating conjunction. Semicolons between the two clauses or sentences indicate that the clauses are closely related. Semicolons can be replaced by the coordinating conjunctions.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> &nbsp;We do not need a car now; we want to sell it. (This semicolon could be replaced by &lsquo;and&rsquo;.</p><p>Common transitional expressions such as <em>therefore, for instance, namely, indeed, additionally, further, moreover, likewise</em>, and <em>finally</em> are used after a semicolon to start a new clause.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>We used to love hunting; however, it is not legal</li><li>He does not like me; likewise, I do not like him.</li><li>It&rsquo;s too cold out here; indeed, it&rsquo;s winter.</li></ul><h2>Hyphen (-)</h2><p><strong> Hyphens</strong> combine words together to make Compound Nouns/Adjectives. Hyphens are also used with some&nbsp;suffixes and prefixes, such as -<em>like</em>, -<em>wise, anti</em>-, and <em>post</em>- to make new adjectives.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Anti-violent</li><li>Dog-like</li><li>Ability-wise</li><li>Decision-making</li><li>City-owned <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>Compound numbers and continuous numbers require <strong>hyphen</strong> in them. A hyphen is used with compound numbers from 21 to 99 in words and with fractions which work as adjectives in the sentence. Fractions which are nouns don&rsquo;t need hyphens.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Sixty-five</li><li>Twenty-five</li><li>Their age is 23-25.</li><li>William Shakespeare (1564-1616)</li><li>Three-fifths full a glass</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Dash (&ndash;)</h2><p>A <strong>dash</strong> hints a brief break in thought or helps to add information to a sentence. A dash has no space before or after it.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>The man was running around the building&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t see his face&mdash;and disappeared down the alley.</li><li>This house&mdash;and every house on the street&mdash;will be connected by this wire.</li><li>Russel Crow&mdash;you know him, I think&mdash;is coming to our locality.</li></ul><p>A dash can replace the conjunctions such as <em>namely, that is, </em>or <em>in other words </em>to add new information or explanation.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>I was thinking about another road&mdash;the one through New York.</li><li>There&rsquo;s only one way not to lose&mdash;don&rsquo;t even participate in the game.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Apostrophe (&rsquo;)</h2><p>An apostrophe indicates possession and the exclusion of letters in contractions.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>They&rsquo;re going to Canada.</li><li>I&rsquo;m not going.</li><li>Robert&rsquo;s watch</li><li>Someone's glasses</li><li>Trees&rsquo; leaves (If there is an &lsquo;s&rsquo; before the apostrophe, no &lsquo;s&rsquo; is needed for it)</li><li>Teams&rsquo; scores</li><li>Jones&rsquo; pen</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Quotation Marks (&lsquo;...&rsquo;/&ldquo;... ... ..&rdquo;)</h2><p><strong>Quotation</strong> <strong>marks</strong> are used for enclosing <em>direct quotations</em> of written or spoken words of others, or<em> dialog</em> said by characters in fiction.</p><p>They are also called <em>quote marks</em> or just <em>quotes</em> for short. The first of the pair is the <em>opening</em> or <em>open quote</em>. It curves to the right: &ldquo; &lsquo;. The second one is the <em>closing</em> or <em>close quote</em>. It curves to the left: &rsquo; &rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Have you seen the music video for the song &ldquo;Despacito&rdquo;?</li><li>&ldquo;Play with aggression&rdquo; shouted the coach.</li><li>Your exact words were &ldquo;get out of my room.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you&rdquo;&ndash;this line from the song &lsquo;Wicked Games&rsquo; always makes me sad.</li></ul><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Commas and periods must always be placed <strong><em>inside</em></strong> the quotation marks, according to most citation systems.</li><li>Colons, as well as, semicolons, on the other hand, should be placed <strong><em>outside</em></strong> the quotation marks.</li><li>Note of interrogation and note of exclamation should be placed <strong><em>inside</em></strong> the quotation marks when they are part of the quoted elements. Seemingly, when the note of interrogation and exclamation are not a part of the quoted materials, they are not placed <strong><em>outside</em></strong> the quotation marks.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Parentheses - ()</h2><p><strong><em>Parentheses</em></strong> block off materials that interrupt the text to add information.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>The parks (in Boston) are always crowded.</li><li>We provide a lot of services. (See our website)</li><li>We provide a lot of services (see our website).</li></ul><h3>Brackets</h3><p><em>Brackets</em> enclose the additional things in the quoted material. These additions are used for clarifications of the words or phrases of the quoted materials.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>&ldquo;It [the river] taught me all I ever knew about life.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Yeats used to love her [Maude Gonne], and he wrote many poems about her.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Every man[sic] must die one day.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I told [Spielberg] I wouldn&rsquo;t do the movie.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Brackets are also required to block off materials that fall within materials which are already enclosed by parentheses.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>We provide a lot of services.

It starts with the same words that begin adjective clauses, e.g., that, who, when, which, where, whether, why, how.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>What we saw at the Thor movie was amazing.</li></ul><p>To understand the types of transformation of sentences we need to know the definition of the Simple Sentences, Complex Sentences, and Compound Sentences.</p><h3>Simple Sentence:</h3><p>When in a sentence that has one independent clause it is called <strong>simple sentence</strong>.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> He confessed his illegal act.</p><h3>Complex Sentence:</h3><p>When in a sentence that has one clause and one or more &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subordinate clauses it is called a <strong>complex sentence.</strong></p><p><strong>Example:</strong> He confessed that he was guilty of his illegal act.</p><h3>Compound Sentence:</h3><p>When in a sentence that has more than one main clause it is called the<strong> compound sentence</strong>.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> I went to watch a movie named Justice League, but the movie was already houseful.</p><h3>Transforming Simple Sentences into Complex Sentences:</h3><p>Converting Simple Sentences into Complex Sentences can be done easily. And this can be done by simply expanding a word or a&nbsp;phrase into a clause. Moreover, we can do the same thing when we want to change the Complex Sentences into Simple Sentences. And this can be done by eliminating a clause into a word or a phrase.</p><p>Few examples are given below to understand the concept and conventional rules of transforming between Simple Sentence and Complex Sentences:-</p><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 1:</span></h3><p><strong>&ldquo;Present participle&rdquo;</strong> in a simple sentence, to convert into complex sentences by adding <strong>&ldquo;since/as/when&rdquo;</strong> at the first half of the sentence.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> Closing the door, I went back to school.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> When I closed the door, I went back to school.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 2</span></h3><p><strong>&ldquo;Being/ Verb+ing&rdquo;</strong> in a simple sentence, to convert into a complex sentence by adding <strong>&ldquo;as/when/since&rdquo;</strong> at the first half of the sentence.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> After winning a beauty contest she cried.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> As she won the beauty contest, she cried.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 3</span></h3><p><strong>&ldquo;Too&hellip;to&rdquo;</strong> in a simple sentence, to convert into a complex sentence by adding <strong>&ldquo;so&hellip;that (negative)&rdquo;</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> He is too weak to carry the box.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> He is so weak that he cannot carry the box.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 4</span></h3><p><strong>&ldquo;To&rdquo; </strong>in the simple sentence, to convert into a complex sentence by adding <strong>&ldquo;so that&rdquo; </strong>in the sentence.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple sentence:</strong> We eat to live.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> We eat so that we can live.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 5</span></h3><p>In the simple sentence <strong>&ldquo;</strong>i<strong>n spite of/ despite&rdquo;, </strong>to convert into the complex sentence by adding <strong>&ldquo;though/ although&rdquo;</strong> in the sentence.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> In spite of being rich, she is hard working.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> Though she is rich, she is hard working.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 6</span></h3><p><strong>&ldquo;Because of&rdquo;</strong> in the simple sentence, to convert it to the complex sentence by adding <strong>&ldquo;since&rdquo;</strong> at the beginning of the sentence.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> Because of his illness, he could not join the meeting.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> Since he was ill, he could not join the meeting.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 7</span></h3><p><strong>&ldquo;Subject + verb + object + present participle&rdquo;</strong> type of simple sentence, to convert it to the complex sentence by <strong>&ldquo;subject + verb + object + relative pronoun of the object + be verb according to relative pronoun and tense + rest of the sentence&rdquo;</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> I saw a bird flying.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> I saw a bird which was flying.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 8</span></h3><p>In the simple sentence starts with <strong>&ldquo;without&rdquo;</strong>,<strong> &nbsp;</strong>by adding <strong>&ldquo;if/ in case&rdquo;</strong> is converted into the complex sentence.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> Without adding the sugar the dish will taste bad.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> If you do not add sugar the dish will taste bad.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 9</span></h3><p>In the simple sentence <strong>&ldquo;at the time&rdquo; </strong>will be converted into <strong>&ldquo;when&rdquo;</strong> in the complex sentence.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> She woke up at the time of load shedding.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> She woke up when it was load shedding.</li></ul><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Rule: 10:</span></h3><p>In the simple sentence, <strong>&ldquo;adjective&rdquo; </strong>will be converted into <strong>&ldquo;that/which&rdquo;</strong> in the complex sentence.</p><ul><li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> It was a blue shirt.</li><li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> It was a shirt which was blue.</li></ul>"

    "content": "<p><em>David said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m baking a chocolate cake for you.&rsquo;&rsquo;</em></p><p><em>David said that he was baking a chocolate cake for me. </em></p><p>If we consider these two sentences, we might notice that both of them convey the same message, but there is a difference if we look closely. In the first sentence, I am conveying the activities of David in his (D) own words without changing it; it is called <strong>direct speech</strong> or we can say <strong>reporting speech</strong>. In the second sentence, I am using my own words to convey the activities of the speaker (D) to the audience. This we can say <strong>indirect speech</strong> or <strong>reported speech</strong>.</p><p>There are some major rules to change these speeches from direct to indirect. We need to consider the <strong>tense, pronoun, words</strong> that describe time, place, distance, types of sentences, etc. let&rsquo;s have a glance at the following rules:</p><h3>1. Pronoun:</h3><p>In an indirect speech the pronoun changes according to the speaker whether s/he is referring himself/herself or a third person. We can make this clearer if we learn this with some examples:</p><ul><li>Direct: George said, &ldquo;<strong>I</strong> cannot be with <strong>you</strong>.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: George said that <strong>he</strong> could not be with <strong>me</strong>.</li><li>Direct:<strong> I</strong> said, &ldquo;Leave <strong>me</strong>&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect:<strong> I</strong> ordered to leave <strong>me</strong> alone. (Note: in this sentence the speaker is same, so there is no change in the indirect speech.)</li><li>Direct: They said, &ldquo;<strong>We</strong> will be partying tonight.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: They said that <strong>they </strong>would be partying that night.</li><li>Direct: I told George, &ldquo;<strong>You</strong> should stay.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: I told George that <strong>he</strong> should stay.</li><li>Direct: She asked, &ldquo;How are <strong>you</strong> doing today?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: She asked me how<strong> I</strong> was doing that day.</li><li>Direct: Robert said, &ldquo;Can <strong>you</strong> pull <strong>me</strong> up?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Robert asked if <strong>I</strong> could pull <strong>him</strong> up.</li></ul><h3>2. Type of sentences:</h3><p><strong>a. Reporting Interrogative sentences: </strong></p><p><strong>I)</strong> If there is a yes-no question in the direct speech, then the reported speech will start with <em>whether/if </em>and the reported clause form will be (subject+verb).</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Peter said, &ldquo;Are you from Australia?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Peter asked if I was from Australia.</li><li>Direct: Tom asked, &ldquo;Do you want to sit here?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Tom asked whether I wanted to sit there.</li></ul><p><strong>II) </strong>In indirect speech questions starting with who, whom, when, how, where and what the wh-word would be the subject or the object of the reported clause:</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Brad said, &ldquo;Who will come with me?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Brad asked who would go with him.</li><li>Direct: Tina said, &ldquo;What will be the charges?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Tina inquired what the charges would be.</li><li>Direct: I said the man, &ldquo;Where is the hotel?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: I asked the man where the hotel was.</li><li>Direct: Mother said, &ldquo;How is the chicken?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Mother asked me how the chicken was.</li></ul><p><strong>b. Reporting statement sentences:</strong></p><p>In a statement speech, we will use &lsquo;that&rsquo; before the reported statement and the reported verb will be &lsquo;told&rsquo; (followed by an object) or &lsquo;said&rsquo; (will not be followed by an object).</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Edward said, &ldquo;I like the book.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Edward said that he liked the book.</li><li>Direct: Alice said, &ldquo;I want you to sing.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Alice told me to sing.</li></ul><p><strong>c. Reporting imperative sentences: </strong></p><p>We will use &lsquo;to&rsquo; as joining clause before the reported command or request, and the reported verb will be changed according to the moods of the sentence (e.g., ordered, requested, urged, advised, forbade or begged)</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: The man said, &ldquo;Please, bring me a chair.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: The man requested to bring him a chair.</li><li>Direct: The officer said, &ldquo;Fall back!&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: The officer ordered to fall back.</li><li>Direct: Mother said, &ldquo;Listen to your elders.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Mother advised me to listen to my elders.</li><li>Direct: Mr. Murphy said, &ldquo;Do not go near the house.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Mr. Murphy forbade going near the house.</li></ul><p><strong>d. Reporting exclamatory sentences: </strong></p><p>To change direct exclamatory speeches to the indirect one we need to replace interjection (hurrah, wow, alas, oh, etc.) with joining clause &lsquo;that&rsquo; and the exclamatory wh-words (what, how) will be replaced by &lsquo;very&rsquo; before the adjective in the reported clause.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Clare said, &ldquo;Hurrah! Barcelona won the match!&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Clare exclaimed with joy that Barcelona had won the match.</li><li>Direct: I said, &ldquo;Alas! My pet died.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: I exclaimed with grief that my pet had died.</li></ul><h3>3. Tense:</h3><p>Usually, the present changes to past tense while we change direct speech to indirect. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>a. Simple present tense to simple past tense:</strong></p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: She said, &ldquo;I work in New York Times.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: She said that she worked in New York Times.</li><li>Direct: Jim said, &ldquo;Bill loves to drink Wine.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Jim said that Bill loved to drink Wine.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Exceptions</em>:</strong> If the content is still true or happening then we do not need to change the tense in the reported speech. Like;</p><ul><li>Direct: She said, &ldquo;I live in Paris.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: She said that she lives in Paris.</li></ul><p><strong>b. Present continuous to past continuous tense</strong></p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Mother said, &ldquo;Bob is taking a nap.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Mother said that Bob was taking a nap.</li><li>Direct: He asked, &ldquo;Are they writing the paper?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: He asked if they were writing the paper.</li></ul><p><strong>c. Present perfect to past perfect tense:</strong></p><p><strong>Example:&nbsp; </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Nicolas said, &ldquo;I have made a donut.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Nicolas said that he had made a donut.</li><li>Direct: The teacher said, &ldquo;The dates have been decided.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: The teacher announced that the dates had been decided.</li></ul><p><strong>d. Present perfect continuous to past perfect continuous tense:</strong></p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Mr. Parson asked, &ldquo;How long have you been working here?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Parson asked me how long I had been working there?&rdquo;</li><li>Direct: The boy said, &ldquo;I have been waiting for my mother since morning.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: The boy said that he had been waiting for his mother since morning.</li></ul><p><strong>e. Simple past to past perfect tense</strong></p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Robert Langdon said, &ldquo;My mother gave me the Mickey watch.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Robert Langdon said that his mother had given the Mickey watch to him.</li><li>Direct: The teacher said, &ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s playing company built Globe Theatre in 1599.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: The teacher said that Shakespeare&rsquo;s playing company had built the Globe Theatre in 1599.</li></ul><p><strong>f. Past Continuous to Past Perfect Continuous tense; </strong></p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Jenny said, &ldquo;Marlow was leaving Belgium.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Jenny told me that Marlow had been leaving Belgium.</li><li>Direct: Maria said, &ldquo;I was dialing your number, and you called.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Maria said that she had been dialing my number and I had called.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> If two sentences are combined with a conjunction, and both sentences have different tenses then we need to change the tenses of both sentences according to the rule.</p><p><strong>g. Past perfect tense does not change in the indirect speech;</strong></p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Alex said, &ldquo;I had stopped to visit you.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Alex said that he has stopped to visit me.</li><li>Direct: She said, &ldquo;Greece had tried to uphold their economy.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: She said that Greece had tried to uphold their economy.</li></ul><p><strong>h Simple future tense to present conditional;</strong></p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Direct: Smith said, &ldquo;My parents will be there at 9am.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Smith said that his parents would be there at 9am.</li><li>Direct: Barbara asked, &ldquo;Will you be my partner in the coming Summer Ball?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Barbara asked if I would be her partner in the coming Summer Ball.</li><li>Direct: John said, &ldquo;I will be doing my CELTA next year.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: John said that he would be doing his CELTA next year. (Continuous conditional)</li></ul><h3>4. Modals:</h3><p><strong>a.</strong> Modal verbs like shall, will, can, may change in reported speech. Let&rsquo;s follow some examples:</p><ul><li>Direct: John said, &ldquo;I <strong>will</strong> be there.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: John promised that he <strong>would </strong>be there.</li><li>Direct: The boy said, &ldquo;<strong>May</strong> I come in?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: The boy asked if he <strong>could</strong> come in. (note: may becomes could when it implies permission)</li><li>Direct: &ldquo;I <strong>may</strong> not call you.&rdquo; Said Boby.</li><li>Indirect: Boby said that she <strong>might</strong> not call me.</li><li>Direct: &ldquo;I <strong>shall</strong> practice more.&rdquo; said Barbara.</li><li>Indirect: Barbara said that she <strong>would</strong> practice more.</li><li>Direct: Joseph said, &ldquo;<strong>Shall</strong> I buy the car?&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Joseph asked if he <strong>should</strong> buy the car.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> shall becomes should if it implies a question.</p><p><strong>b.</strong> Modal verbs like could, should, need, must, might, used to do not change in reported speech.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Direct: she said, &ldquo;I would not be the victim.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: she said that she would not be the victim.</li><li>Direct: David said, &ldquo;You need to repair the car.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: David said that I need to repair the car.</li><li>Direct: Mary said, &ldquo;I used to love dancing.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Mary said she used to love dancing.</li></ul><h3>5. Adverbs and demonstratives:</h3><p>Indirect speech differs from the direct speech&rsquo;s time and place. When someone is conveying the message to the listener, the speaker might not be on the same day or place. So the demonstrative (this, that etc.) and the adverb of time and place (here, there, today, now, etc.) change. We can look into the following chart for the usual changes:</p><table border='1' class='table table-bordered'><tbody><tr><td>direct</td><td>indirect</td></tr><tr><td>now</td><td>Then/at that moment</td></tr><tr><td>today</td><td>That day</td></tr><tr><td>Tomorrow</td><td>The next day</td></tr><tr><td>Yesterday</td><td>The day before</td></tr><tr><td>come</td><td>go</td></tr><tr><td>Bring</td><td>take</td></tr><tr><td>this</td><td>that</td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;<strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li>Direct: I said, &ldquo;Simon read Wordsworth <strong>yesterday</strong>.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: I said that Simon read Wordsworth <strong>the day before</strong>.</li><li>Direct: Mother said, &ldquo;<strong>Come</strong> home <strong>now</strong>.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: Mother ordered me to <strong>go</strong> home <strong>at that moment</strong>.</li><li>Direct: &ldquo;<strong>Bring</strong> the money with you.&rdquo; Said Jessie.</li><li>Indirect: Jessie demanded to <strong>take </strong>the money with me.</li><li>Direct: The lovers said, &ldquo;We will meet <strong>here tomorrow</strong>.&rdquo;</li><li>Indirect: The lovers promised to meet <strong>there the next day</strong>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

    "content": "<p><strong><em>The mood</em></strong> in English grammar does not refer to the emotion of the action or anything like that. Instead, the <strong><em>mood</em></strong> of the verbs refers to whether or not something is a fact. The intention of the speaker/writer is understood by the mood of the verbs.</p><p>In English, there are mainly <strong>three kinds</strong> of mood:</p><ul ><li>Indicative mood</li><li>Imperative mood</li><li>Subjunctive mood</li></ul><p>Each of the types has a particular function.</p><h3 id='indicative'>Indicative Mood</h3><p><strong>Indicative mood</strong> tells the reader/listener something factual. This mood is generally used in making a <strong><em>statement</em></strong> or asking for a statement by a <strong><em>question</em></strong>. The statement can be factual or <strong>presumed to be factual. </strong></p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>Michel was the greatest musician.</li><li>Where are you going?</li><li>I am going to Texas.</li></ul><h3 id='imperative'>Imperative Mood</h3><p><strong>Imperative mood</strong> makes a verb into a command or request. It always uses <strong><em>the second person</em></strong> as the subject of the sentence and most of the time the subject remains hidden.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Bring the bottle over here.</li><li>Make me a cup of tea, please.</li><li>Let her take her own decisions. (Here, <strong><em>&lsquo;let&rsquo;</em></strong> is the verb of this sentence, not <strong><em>&lsquo;take&rsquo;</em></strong>.)</li></ul><h3 id='sujunctive'>Subjunctive Mood</h3><p><strong>Subjunctive mood</strong> indicates the possibility, wishes, or hypothetical statements. It is almost the opposite of the <strong>indicative mood. </strong>This mood usually mixes the tense of the verbs and does not follow the common usage of the tense.</p><p><strong>Subjunctive</strong> has some different structures from the other structures of sentences.</p><p><strong>Conditionals</strong> generally use the subjunctive mood.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>If you change this dress, I will take you with me.</li><li>If I were in your shoes, I would not do it.</li><li>If they were in America, they could not escape from it.</li><li>If they had taken the vaccine, they would not have been affected.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Some certain verbs</em></strong> + the conjunction <strong><em>that</em></strong> requires the next clause to use the subjunctive mood and the clause uses the base form of the verb in it.</p><p>The verbs are: &nbsp;</p><table border='1' class='table table-bordered'><tbody><tr><td><strong>Advise &ndash; demand &ndash; prefer &ndash; require &ndash; ask &ndash; insist Propose &ndash; stipulate &ndash; command &ndash; recommend&nbsp; Suggest &ndash; decree &ndash; order &ndash; request &ndash; urge &ndash; move </strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Structure: </strong></p><table border='1' class='table table-bordered'><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subject + the verbs of the above box </strong>(any tense)<strong> + THAT + subject + base verb + .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>He insisted that I <strong>stay</strong> at home.</li><li>The office requires that we <strong>complete</strong> our work timely.</li><li>She commanded that he <strong>stop</strong> drinking alcohol.</li><li>I recommend that you <strong>wake</strong> up early.</li></ul><p><strong>Note: </strong>There are some clauses also which require the verb of the next clause to be in base form.</p><p>The clauses are:</p><table border='1' class='table table-bordered'><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>It is/was + past participle form of the verb of the above box + THAT</strong></p><p><strong>It is/was urgent + THAT</strong></p><p><strong>It is/was necessary + THAT</strong></p><p><strong>It is/was important + THAT</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li>It is important that you <strong>invite</strong> him to the party.</li><li>It was necessary that I <strong>make</strong> a fence.</li><li>It was recommended that you <strong>meet</strong> the principal.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>"

    "title": "Do-support",
    "exercise": "exercises-on-do-insertion-do-support-with-explanation.json",
    "content": "<p>In English grammar, &lsquo;<strong>do-insertion</strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong>do-support</strong>&rsquo; refers to the use of the auxiliary verb &lsquo;do&rsquo;, including its reflected forms &lsquo;does&rsquo; and &lsquo;did'. There are some common uses of do-insertion which are described below.</p><h3>To ask a question:</h3><p>We consider a sentence, &ldquo;You want money&rdquo;.<br /> Here, 'you' is the subject, 'want' is the verb and 'money' is the complement. But there is no auxiliary verb in this sentence. That's why we need to add a dummy 'do' to turn this assertive sentence into an interrogative sentence.</p><ul><li>You want money (You do want money).<br /> -Do you want money?</li></ul><p>Similarly,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>She likes the dress (She does like the dress).<br /> -Does she like the dress?</li><li>He got the job (He did get the job).<br /> - Did he get the job?</li></ul><h3>To make a negative sentence:</h3><p>We need to add the word 'not' to the auxiliary verb.<br /> <strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>You want money.<br /> -You do not want money/ You don't want money.</li></ul><p>Similarly,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>She likes the dress.<br /> -She does not like the dress/ She doesn't like the dress.</li><li>He got the job.<br /> -He did not get the job/ He didn't get the job.</li></ul><p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: In most cases, we need to add the auxiliary 'do' to make a question or negative sentence except the use of the verb 'be' and the verb 'have'.</p><h3>Be:</h3><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>You are rich (are=be verb).<br /> To make it negative, we can say<br /> -You are not rich/ You aren't rich.</p><p>But we can't say say<br /> -You don't are rich.</p><p>Similarly to make a question, we can say<br /> -Are you rich?</p><p>But we can't say,&nbsp;<br /> -Do you are rich?</p><p>So instead of adding an auxiliary 'do' with the verb 'be', we can invert the verb 'be' with the subject.</p><h3>Have:</h3><p>In UK/ England, the same rule works with the verb 'have' also. So when we say</p><p>I have a dream.</p><p>-Have I a dream? (Question)</p><p>Or, Do I have a dream? (Question)</p><p>-I have not a dream/ I haven't a dream/ I don't have a dream. (Negative)</p><p>So there are only two exceptions to the 'do-insertion' in question and in a negative sentence. These are with the verb 'be' and the verb 'have'.</p><h3>To put emphasis in imperative sentence</h3><p>We also use the do-insertion with an imperative sentence when we want to put the emphasis.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><p>Instead of saying to a kid,&nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;Behave!&rdquo;<br /> We can say, &ldquo;Do behave!&rdquo;<br /> It means to put emphasis on 'behave' which is like giving an order.</p><h3>In tag question</h3><p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You want a bike, don't you?</p><p>We are using dummy 'do' in this tag question because there is no auxiliary verb in this sentence. So we are adding an auxiliary as well as 'not' because the tag question usually has to be opposite to the actual sentence (if the question is positive, the tag question will be negative).</p><p>Similarly,</p><p>We want freedom, don't we?</p><p>She likes to play, doesn't she?</p><h3>To answer a question by using 'yes/no'</h3><p>When we need to answer shortly in 'yes' or 'no', we can use the dummy operator or the modal verb or the auxiliary to answer.</p><p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Are you busy?<br /> -Yes, I do.</p><p>Here, the verb 'be' doesn't take the 'do' operator', so this reply is wrong. We can reply</p><p>-Yes, I am. (Positive)<br /> -No, I am not. (Negative)</p><p>Similarly,<br /> Have you a car?<br /> -Yes, I have. (Positive)<br /> -No, I don't have. (Negative)</p><p>Do you want a pen?<br /> -Yes, I do.<br /> -No, I don't.</p><h3>&lsquo;Tense inflection' and 'Third person inflection'</h3><p>What's special about 'do' is that it takes the 'tense inflection' and the 'third person inflection'.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>He has a sister.<br /> -he have a sister (this is wrong because 'he' is third person singular number).</p><p>So we should say<br /> -Does he have a sister?</p><p>So only one of a verb the 'do' takes a person inflection.</p><p>He doesn't have a sister.<br /> -He doesn't has a sister. (Wrong)<br /> -He don't has a sister. (Wrong)</p><p>When we say a sentence in the past tense</p><p>He had a sister.<br /> -Did he have a sister? (Question)<br /> Here, we put the tense inflection on the 'do'. So 'do' becomes 'did' and 'has' becomes 'have'.</p><p>He had a sister.<br /> -He didn't have a sister. (Negative)</p><h3>Modal verbs</h3><p>Modal verbs are verbs that act like auxiliary verbs. For example: can, could, be able to, may, might, shall, should, must, have to, will, would, etc.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>I will go.<br /> -Will I go?</p><p>She should leave now.<br /> -Should she leave now?</p><p>The modal verbs act like an auxiliary, and they invert with the subject to make a question, to make a negative sentence and to make tag question.</p>"

    "content": "<p><strong>Negation</strong>, as maintained by the likes of Merriam Webster refers to</p><blockquote>&ldquo;the action or logical operation of&nbsp;negating&nbsp;or making&nbsp;negative&rdquo;.</blockquote><p>In simpler terms, <strong>negation</strong> defines the polar opposition of affirmative, denies the existence or vaguely &ndash; a refutation. This is also known as &ldquo;Not&rdquo;. Classical logic resembles negation with truth function which takes truth to falsity and is perfectly capable of running the opposite operation. It denies the truth of a sentence. It&rsquo;s just the conversion of the affirmative sentence which converts the simple affirmative sentence into negative.</p><p><strong>Example</strong></p><ul><li>I like to sing = I do not like to sing.</li></ul><h2>Rules of Negation:</h2><p>By changing the auxiliary verb of the sentence into negative, we can apply Negation in a sentence.</p><h3><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>1.

Please, notice that a double negative can often result in an affirmation in the English language (e.g., He hardly stops for small-talks). The rhetorical term for such a phenomenon is &lsquo;litotes&rsquo;.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>I can not find him nowhere.</li></ul><h3>Uses of Double Negative</h3><p>Double Negative can be used in two ways. They are:</p><p><strong>1. Using negative words</strong></p><p>such as never,&nbsp;nobody,&nbsp;anyone,&nbsp;nothing,&nbsp;nowhere, etc</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>He cannot go nowhere without informing me</li></ul><p><strong>2. Using prefix</strong></p><p>Such as ir, un, non, pre, anti, il, im, etc.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>John is not uncontrollable by his family member though he is a special child.</li></ul><p>In modern English, Double Negatives are highly avoidable as it is grammatically wrong. We know we cannot use more than one negative word in a statement. It usually used in informal conversation or speech and in songs&rsquo; lyrics as well. To form a correct sentence, we must avoid using a double negative in a single sentence formally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

    "title": "Inversion",
    "exercise": "inversion-exercise-practice-with-explanation.json",
    "content": "<p>Inversion of the verb before the subject is a common phenomenon in English sentences. The natural order of English sentences is <strong>(subject + verb + . . . .) </strong>but sometimes it becomes <strong>(verb + subject)</strong>. Inversion is most common with question form of the sentences. However, there are few other circumstances where inversion of subject and verb occurs.</p><h3>Inversion in questions:</h3><p>Almost all forms of&nbsp;interrogative sentences (without <strong><em>subject questions</em></strong> and <strong><em>embedded questions</em></strong>) use inversion. These sentences always place the&nbsp;auxiliary verb before the subject.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong></p><ul><li><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Is</span></strong> he going to the club?</li><li><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Did</span></strong> he go to the club?</li><li>Where <strong>is</strong> the club?</li><li>Who is that guy standing there? (No inversion for it is a subject question)</li></ul><h3>Inversion in other expressions:</h3><p>Many other negative and affirmative sentences use inversion.</p><p>1. Affirmative and negative agreement: only after <strong><em>so, nor, neither</em></strong> but not in the cases of <strong><em>either</em></strong> and <strong><em>too</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Examples: </strong></p><ul><li>Alex went to the club, and so <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>did</span> Jenny.</strong></li><li>Alex went to the club, and Jenny did too.

(No inversion)</li><li>Russel is not a footballer, and nor <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>is</span> his brother</strong></li></ul><p>2. Negative adverbial expressions at the beginning of the sentence.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>In no way <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>should</span></strong> we accept their offer.</li><li>Little <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>did</span></strong> they know about me.</li><li>Never <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>has</span></strong> he felt so embarrassed.</li><li>Seldom <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>do</span></strong> they go</li><li>Rarely <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>do</span></strong> we see gypsies.</li><li>Hardly ever <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>do</span></strong> they talk to each other.</li></ul><p>3.

Adverbs of place&nbsp;(<strong>here &amp; there)</strong> at the beginning of a sentence. This type of sentence requires the main verb (not the auxiliary verb) to come before the subject.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><ul><li>There <strong><em>is</em></strong> a lady standing in front of the club.</li><li>Here <strong><em>comes</em></strong> the king.</li><li>Here <strong><em>is</em></strong> your home-made cola.</li><li>There <strong><em>are</em></strong> so many people in that field.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;6.

    "exercise": "",
    "content": "<p>An object is a noun or pronoun that gives meaning to the subject and the verb in a sentence. It often follows the subject and verb in a sentence. There are two ways of writing the objects of many verbs without changing the meaning of the sentence: <strong>direct objects and indirect objects</strong>. The indirect object may appear before the direct object without being preceded by a preposition or it may occur after the direct object, preceded by a preposition. The prepositions that are generally used in this structure are <em>for</em> and <em>to</em>.</p> <p>The direct object is a person or a thing and is the first receiver of the action. On the other hand, the indirect object is an animate object or objects to whom or for whom something is done.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary showed <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>the photograph</span> <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>to me.</span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>direct object</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>indirect object</sup></p> <p>(the photograph is the direct object because the first action was that of showing the photo, and the second action, the indirect one, was to show to me.)</p> <p>Although objects are basically nouns or pronouns, verbs play an important role in how the object will behave.

    "content": "<p>The sequence of tense implies when two clauses make up a sentence the tense of the subordinate verb is changed according to the tense of the main verb. <br />So, we need to determine the tense of the principal clause and modify the tense of subordinate clause accordingly as there should be a relative coherence of time. If there is no coherence of time in the two clauses than the sentence will be incorrect.</p> <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan='3'><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Example 1</strong></td> <td>I went to the restaurant as I am hungry.</td> <td><strong>Incorrect</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>I went to the restaurant as I will be hungry.</td> <td><strong>Incorrect</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>I went to the restaurant as I was hungry.</td> <td><strong>Correct</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan='3'><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Example 2</strong></td> <td>He is arrested as he will be robbing the bank.</td> <td><strong>Incorrect</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>He is arrested as he is robbing a bank.</td> <td><strong>Incorrect</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>He is arrested as he had robbed a bank.</td> <td><strong>Correct</strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>To maintain the sequence of tense, we should maintain the following rules:</span></p> <p><strong>Rule:</strong> If the principal clause is in present tense then the subordinate clause can be in present continuous, present perfect, future or past tense.</p> <p><strong>For example:</strong></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Examples</strong></td> <td><strong>Subordinate Clause</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>I know what you are thinking right now.</td> <td>Present Continuous</td> </tr> <tr> <td>I think he has crossed the line.</td> <td>Present Perfect</td> </tr> <tr> <td>She says that she will think about it.</td> <td>Future Indefinite</td> </tr> <tr> <td>I hope you made the right choice.</td> <td>Past Indefinite</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>If the subordinate clause is in present continuous tense while the principal clause in present indefinite tense, then it means both actions are simultaneous. If the subordinate clause is in present perfect tense while the principal clause is in present indefinite tense, then it means the action described in subordinate clause took place at an indefinite time before that of the principal clause. If the subordinate clause is in future indefinite tense while the principal clause is in present indefinite tense, then it means the action described in subordinate clause will take place after the action of the principal clause. If the subordinate clause is in past indefinite tense while the principal clause is in present indefinite tense, then it means the action described in the subordinate clause took place before the action of the principal clause.</p> <p><strong>Rule: </strong>If the principal clause is in past tense then the subordinate clause can be in past indefinite, continuous or perfect tense.</p> <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Examples</strong></td> <td><strong>Subordinate Clause</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>He said he liked the idea.</td> <td>Past indefinite</td> </tr> <tr> <td>She visited our home while she was studying in London.</td> <td>Past Continuous</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Melissa went there as her husband had told her.</td> <td>Past Perfect</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>If the subordinate clause is in past indefinite or continuous tense then it means the actions were simultaneous. If the subordinate clause is in past perfect tense then it means the action described in the subordinate clause happened before the action of the principal clause.</p> <p><strong>Rule: </strong>Usually, no present form is allowed in the subordinate clause if the principal clause is in past tense. But if the subordinate clause starts with &ldquo;than&rdquo;, then the subordinate clause can be in any tense.</p> <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Examples</strong></td> <td><strong>Subordinate Clause</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>I miss my dad more than I miss anything.</td> <td>Present</td> </tr> <tr> <td>I miss my dad more than I missed anything.</td> <td>Past</td> </tr> <tr> <td>I miss my dad more than I will miss anything.</td> <td>Future</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Rule: </strong>If the principal clause is in future tense then the subordinate clause is usually in present tense.</p> <p><strong>For example:</strong></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan='2'>Example 1</td> <td>I will go to play when the rain will stop.</td> <td>Incorrect</td> </tr> <tr> <td>I will go to play when the rain stops.</td> <td>Correct</td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan='2'>Example 2</td> <td>He will text me when the teacher will arrive.</td> <td>Incorrect</td> </tr> <tr> <td>He will text me when the teacher arrives.</td> <td>Correct</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p>"

And if the question is in present or past indefinite form, then the auxiliary verb should be omitted and the verb needs to be changed to its appropriate form.</p> <p><span style='text-decoration: underline;'><strong>For example:</strong></span></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> What work did he do best?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> I&rsquo;d like to know what work he did best.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> What is her name?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> I wonder what her name is.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>If there&rsquo;s an &ldquo;auxiliary&rdquo; or &ldquo;to be&rdquo; verb included within the embedded question, the position of the subject and the &ldquo;auxiliary&rdquo; or &ldquo;to be&rdquo; verb needs to be reversed.</p> <p><span style='text-decoration: underline;'><strong>For example:</strong></span></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> Is the doctor available?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> Could you tell me if the doctor is available?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> What was his job here?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> I wonder what his job was here.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Using verbal contraction at the end of the sentence is not acceptable in the case of embedded question.</p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> How tall are they?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> Do you know how tall they are? (correct)<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> Do you know how tall they&rsquo;re? (incorrect)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> How talkative is she?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> Can you tell me how talkative she is? (correct)<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> Can you tell me how talkative she&rsquo;s? (incorrect)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>There are some questions which don&rsquo;t have any question words and so they begin with an auxiliary verb. In such cases, embedded questions are introduced by whether, if and whether or not.</p> <p><span style='text-decoration: underline;'><strong>For example:</strong></span></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> Was she sick?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> Could you tell me if she was sick or not?<br /> <strong>Or,</strong> Could you tell me whether or not she was sick?<br /> <strong>Or,</strong> Could you tell me whether she was sick or not?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> Are you mad?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> I wonder if you are mad or not.<br /> <strong>Or,</strong> I wonder whether or not you are mad.<br /> <strong>Or,</strong> I wonder whether you are mad or not.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Sometimes the question word can be followed by an infinitive, as shown in the following example:</p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> Where could I look for her?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> Could you tell me where I could look for her?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question with an Infinitive:</strong> Could you tell me where to look for her?</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> How should I prepare for a train journey?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure how I should prepare for a train journey.<br /> <strong>Embedded Question with an Infinitive:</strong> I&rsquo;m not sure how to prepare for a train journey.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>At times native English speakers tend to use embedded questions rather than direct questions while inquiring about something. Because it makes the question sound more polite.</p> <p><strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>For example:</span></strong></p> <table class='table table-bordered' border='1'> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Direct Question:</strong> When does the train leaves for Chicago?<br /> <strong>Embedded Question:</strong> Can you please tell me when the train leaves for Chicago?</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"
