[{"title":"Opinion","content":[{"question":"Being a celebrity such as film star or sports pedrsonality brings problems as well as benefits do you think that being a celebrity brings more benefits or more problems?","answer":"Nowadays, the importance of celebrity plays a crucial role in humans life. However most folk argue athat being a celebrity like film star or sports personality have advantage and disadvantage sometimes. In my opinion,I partially agree with this statement.Lets triggers debate on the topic\n\nTo commence with, firstly, if they are celebrity then they fulfill there all dreams whatever they want because of too much wealth.Therefore they live happy in their life. Secondly, they live like a luxurious life because they do not have any problem to go in stress .Moreover they spend their time with their fans to enjoy most and inhance their name in the World. For instance , one of my favourite celebrity Zayn Malik he has a lot of money and he is born in London but now he is working in America to fulfill his all dreams and becoming more famous.\n\nNevertheless, there are disadvantage also for celebrity.Basically they \ncannot hide their privacy because of interruption by social media . Progressively few denizens hate some celebrities they started to spread fake rumours in the society so the people start to unfollow them because few in habitants want to enhance their famous celebrity name. Finally celebrity cannot roam alone on the street because of few haters also exist there but celebrity dont know. So they can attack suddenly on celebrity. For example ,one of my famous celebrity taking enjoyment with his friends but he is not in a privacy so he has killed by their haters on the street.\n\nIn conclusion, although being a popular celebrity is a good thing for them to make their happy life with their family members but up to some extent there is problem in their uplifting lifestyle because in this world everytype of denizens are living."},{"question":"People attend colleges or universities for many different reasons(for example new experiences ,career preparation increased knowledge etc ).Why do you think people attend colleges or universities ?","answer":"Nowadays education plays a pivotal role in every individual life .However folks attend colleges or universities for several different reasons like to accomplish their experiences and knowledge as well as doing preparation for upcoming their career .In my opinion i consider that there are other causes also ,that may improve uplifting life by attending college or university.Lets have a glance to tell about this in description .\n\nTo commence with there are multifarious reasons that why youth prefer to attend colleges or universities .Firstly , having a good career is one of the main reason .However , in todays world colleges and universities are the authority to declare a person to have necessary education to be ready fore job sector and it is almost impossible for people those are without certification of colleges or universities and getting a good job . for instance , one of my friend near my uncle house , he always go to attend university to make his bright career.Howeverhr give the value to others as well as he have lot of experiences in the society and after taking certificate from university he become a successful person .\n\nNevertheless, there are other reason also that can make happy life by attending colleges or universities Basically , social network of people will increases as well as their skills .More over ,they can learn which type of wards are living in this world . furthermore , they will aware of environment . for example one of my neighbor , he is completed his study from university and he have lot of experience or knowledge which is common in this era but he is excellent in other activities also which is quite beneficial to have in every individual life . So , now he is going to take post of IS .\n\nalthough , knowledge and experience as well as career is important in the university or college life but there should be other reason also that help to enhance their life"},{"question":"Countries become more and more similar,because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world.Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","answer":"In this present age, all nations are more alike because of globalization.Therefore,the public can easily purchase their desired similar brand of items everywhere in this universe.This essay discuss about the positive and negative development followed by a reasonable conclusion.\n\nIt is quite evident that,there are some positive development due to the advancement in recent era. First of all,it helps the people to purchase all the items within their domain.Additionally,it curtails the unnecessary migration to other destinations to buy things when all the commodities are available in the local market with a reasonable cost.Moreover,this development assist the people to relish their desires which are being nightmare at some point of time in their life.Forexample;In developing countries like India,almost nearly all the western popular trends are reachable in all retail stores at an affordable price with similar quality.As a result of this,it ensures the public to get utilized in their own soil rather than flying to alien country.This is a record of positive development.\n\nHowever,as the positive development gauges,there are some darker side in the development aswell.The prime reason is,the items are more expensive while importing goods from other country.Subsequently excessive duty will be imposed to meet the transportation charges and profit.Again ,the inclusion of value added tax for all goods and services that are to be sold for consumption also mounts the pressure on the people.To illustrate this:Underdeveloped countries like Maldives solely depend on other nations for all consumables.Since there is no manufacturing industries, everything is reach in hand but are more expensive with additional taxes.This is the result of the negative development.\n\nIn conclusion,,though all the countries are resemble same it is more feasible for the public to purchase anywhere in the world,to my knowledge this is the positive development the era has seen."},{"question":"Government should pay more money on railways rather than roads. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement.","answer":"In the recent years, transportation system is not only getting importance but also developing at a rapid rate. Owing to this reason, Government is also trying to improve transportation system through mega projects on railways and roads. However, the government should work to develop more railways compared to roads. In my opinion, spending on roads would be more beneficial compared to roads. There are many reasons behind this thought and are listed here.\n\nFirstly, roads due to large number of vehicles cause various issues as traffic jam, rush in peak hours, and noise. For example, during the morning time, many people on the roads get stuck due to heavy load of vehicles and also use horn to attain attention of others which cause noise. On the other hand, railways not only avoid nose problem but also cause not traffic jam.\nSecondly, railways produce less air pollution compared to vehicles on the roads. There are lots of air emissions due to heavy traffic on the roads as most of the people use individual vehicles while travelling. This problem can be avoided easily by using railways which carry large number of people on single unit and also cause less pollution.\n\nFinally, railways also save money as large number of people travel on a single train which reduces money use on fuel as well as on payment of taxes when compared with cars on roads.\n\nTo sum up, due to technological advancement and development in the different areas, there is a need to improve transportation system. Therefore, government should pay more attention on building railways rather than on roads."},{"question":"Some people believe that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer.\nWhat, in your opinion , should be the main function of a university?","answer":"It is believed by a few people that all third-level institutes should conduct lectures on various types of things which are necessary to become a good professional, others,however, think that it is not responsibility of any university to provide, because universities aim is to provide only field related knowledge, which I believe, is not an appropriate way to reduce unemployment.\n\nTaking other skills other than field related under consideration is road directly to unexpected success. Pupils having only information of their subjects are often rejected by Multinational Companies due to lack of confidence and unawareness of practical work. For instance, taking an example of two ISO certified universities of Pakistan, National University of Science and Technology(NUST) and Mehran UET (MUET), employment ratio of NUST graduates is far greater than the MUET. Although, MUET provides high quality education related to only their subjects but lack of effective skills to hunt a job and strategies to apply at work in MUET graduates is only reason behind their unemployment.\n\nI do appreciate the opinion of those who think that lectures other than subjects are not quite important, and this is not universities cup of tea. To provide only field related education is key to make them able to concentrate only on particular area instead of unbearable load of multiple things at a time. Nevertheless, in order to achieve success in their life, other necessary things apart from field are equally important. Even though, seeking required skills useful at work place parallel with subjects will reduce unemployment rate in near future if we really take this problem seriously.\n\nIn conclusion, providing enormous knowledge about practical work and skills to apply at work place would help them at their workplace, and undoubtedly , it is workable solution to get rid of unemployment."},{"question":"Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. \nIn what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people made?\nHas this become a positive or negative development&? (40 minutes)","answer":"With the cutting-edge technology, the way people keep in touch with each other has altered significantly. This essay agrees that this trend is a negative one and will provide the reasons to show why this development has affected negatively relationships between people.\n\nIn light of rapid technological developments, relationship between people has rather changed meaning that it is worsening day by day. In other words, manifold social websites such as Facebook and messengers have capacitated us to communicate with each other no matter if next door or in Europe. For this very reason, in our modern civilization people simply prefer to communicate through social websites, which in turn leads to deterioration of relationships as long as nothing comes near to moments of real face-to-face human interaction. Thus, if people had not used these technological devices above measure, their relationships would not have been affected.\n\nProliferation of technology has become a negative trend, beyond any doubts. First and foremost reason is that with utilizing these super electronic pastimes for communication above measure, our eye sights have been impacted negatively. In other words, ultra violet rays radiating from the screens of computers and cell phones induce dehydration of eyes, as a result of which our eyes will be damaged and will start to hurt. On the top of that, obsession with communicational devices has fostered the issue of corpulence. Currently, as these devices have enabled us to keep in touch at the touch of a button, people tend to sustain more sedentary lifestyle, which in turn leads to suffering from acute health disorder, obesity. Canada is the quintessential example, due primarily to over usage of electronic devices for communication, a good 65% of population suffer from corpulence. Thus, it is clear why this is a hugely negative trend brimming with enormous drawbacks. \n\nAs has been shown, the proliferation of these communicational devices has had negative reverberations on relationships between people. And this improvement in communication is a negative trend as long as it results in damage of our eye-sights and obesity. Thus, it is hoped that people will be less obsessed with these devices down the road."},{"question":"These days, many jobs require people to travel and this is disrupting many families. What effects do traveling parents have on their children?","answer":"Nowadays, as world is changing exponentially, it has become important for many nuclear families to work as a site employee. As a result, their offspring are facing problems by their traveling.\n\nAs a part of this urbanized society children are experiencing both positive and negative effects. A possible positive impact is that their parents are doing such jobs only for their childs sake. For instance, they are away from their part of heart(children) in order to earn more which in result make them able to educate accordingly, and could be brought in proper dress.\n\nThe positive side of being away from them generally can not be ignored. However, it has negative impacts as well. Firstly, absence of their mums and dads may tend them to do activities which are generally considered to be un-ethical in our society such as drinking alcohol, gambling, and remaining outside from home most of the time. Secondly, parent-child relationship is very sensitive and no doubt plays an important role in their academics. For example, study revealed that adolescents living with their families are more likely to enrol in universities. Since, those who could not get admission in third-level institutions are seem to be totally disrespectful to their parents.\n\nLastly, although most of the time their parents are not in touch with with them may give them authority to think and do what they actually want. No any proper guidance could take them towards wrong path. In fact, they mingle with their friends and try to adopt their ideologies instead of their father or mother which in general will not be helpful in times of hardship.\n\nOn balance, being away from children has overall negative effects. Hence, parents guideline is only light which make their offspring to be a successful person."},{"question":"Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Education is basic need, yet it is believed that all the third-level institutes must have equal quota for both boys and girls. While I agree that there should be gender equality by which this myth: that women are born to handle only internal problems of house could be made wrong and females will be able to solve their problems in their times of hardship, but also few courses are suitable for specific gender.\n\nOn the one hand, accepting both equally for all courses will be helpful for women. Since, they will be able to do office work not only of house.Firstly, Educational Institutes of the many of the developing countries are now advertising equal seats for both which in response, make women more confident. For instance, in our country, Pakistan, nearly 70% of old women are not too educated to do office work or solve financial problems, but now it has been changed, same figure of women are now busy doing their jobs. Secondly, giving them proper education may be helpful after divorce in some cases as they may be able to feed their children.\n\nOn the other hand, some courses suit on their personalities that are made for specific gender somehow. For example, nursing and civil engineering for girls and boys respectively, because in Civil Engineering there is mostly field and labor work which will be difficult for women to do and vice versa.\n\nIn conclusion, it has been proven that, no doubt giving equal opportunities to girls and boys to get admission will be beneficial for girls to work outside the home and in dealing with personal problems, but also few courses are made for specific gender."},{"question":"Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas( in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"There should not be States involvement in any art work or restrictions on freedom of expression. Every artist should be encouraged for his\/her works, because, every one has right to express their ideas or feelings through sketching , singing , and writing or whatever they want to do. While, this essay agrees that they should be given free hand for their profession by which countrys economy may boost but, at the same time this unlimited authority might become root cause of an inappropriate revolution.\n\nOn the one hand, in this modern era every one has equal rights to express what they want. Similarly, this limitless authority will tend them to do endless efforts towards their work which in result will become one of major source of increasing countrys economy. For example, majority of the people spend their money and leisure time on watching movies not only this but, huge collection of portraits in galleries attract large number of foreigners visitors to spend their hard currency in any developing country. The Micheal Angelos work is good example , which attracts people towards it self till today.\n\nOn the other hand,it is said that The only thing by which anyone can easily change the minds of young generation is artistic work. Sometimes a few artists try to take anti-state decisions, which they usually transfer via their works which becomes only reason behind rebellion to government. These unpardonable offences are totally unbearable and unforgivable.\n\nIn conclusion, it has been seen that no doubt full free hand to artists might take country economically high but , also can destroy its elected body of Parliament to a certain extent. Thus, its better to allow them to describe what they actually want, but must be in positive manners and under rules and the regulations."},{"question":"Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. Do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Many countries which have good opportunities for working occasionally need to hire effective kind of labor to make sure that it will increase their domestic production. In my point of view the skilled employees who have good experiences in different work fields, they are a real treasure for their nations indeed.\n\nAt first, in rich states with high levels of living there are many facilities and also a lot of empty places of work. They in need to keep introducing best products and services they may present work chances that serve the objectives of public needs. For instance, specifically in Germany large hospitals need high qualified doctors work for 24-hours service in all specializations, so they hire large numbers of doctors in the same expertise thus they can make sure that all patients will take the appropriate care services in any time.\n\nNow days, labor force that have distinctive advantages like computer and technical skills are very distinguished for any organization. Its obvious that to hire one worker who can do more than one defined task and takes large amount of salary is more profitable than hiring 2 or 3 employees have only one skill to do one task. For example, recruit an expertise engineer who achieved many large projects in his career previously and that will cost you high wage. With no doubt with applying that its still more profitable than hiring another engineer with no real and practical experiments.\n\nTo sum up, its not only a good issue for developed countries to adapt and supporting humans in poor countries but after that they will also gain what they will invest into those persons like a win-win situation."},{"question":"The growing number of overweight people is putting a strain on the health care system in an effort to deal with the health issues involved.Some people think that the best way to deal with this problem is to introduce more physical education lessons in the school curriculum.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Nowadays, it became a harsh problem that growing number of overweight denizens is on depress on the health care system in an effort to compromise with the health issues puzzled.While, other argue that best way to sacked these problem by introducing more physical education lessons in the school activities. In my opinion, i partially agree with this question.Let have a glance to clearify the solution in forthcoming paragraph.\n\nTo commence with, firstly, people need to maintenance themselves to achieve their goal by losing their weight because it is too difficult to find the solution easily.Secondly, they can focus to their food schedule also that they can eat insufficient quantity because in over limit it harm them due to which folk are suffering in stress on the health care system .Thirdly, they can do regular exercise to remove problems that are present inside their body.For instance, in my town mostly people are in depression due to health problem like they are overweight means sufferer of obesity.\n\nAnother point, demos deal these problem by providing more education lessons in the school activities because they will treat to the student for warmupeveryday and their body will remain fit. Moreover, parents can cheerup to their offspring for doing physical activities like playing any sport that refresh the mind and it will work fast. Lastly, people can make compulsory sport subject in every academic than folk can get the rid of this problems. For example, my friends taking much interest in physical activities . So, they have no problem in their body, no tension and leaving happy..\n\nIn conclusion, Although, I recommended that it is good way to solve this problem by taking part in physical education in the school activities , some other factors also that they can take care about themselves and do regular exercise in their home"},{"question":"out of all public transport options,a metro is the most convenient way to get around a large city.\nDo you agree or disagree","answer":"In many parts of the world,advance transportation system has been developed for public mobility.thus,this can be seen as underground rail is playing an effective role to commute now a days.I agree with this eassy that subway is more convenient from all others way of public transportation especially in dense n busy cities.Thiseassy will support this by looking at how metro is convenience and low cost...\n\nFristly,it must be recognised that metro is the frist choice for most of the commuters because of its convenience and easily availability especially in rush hours.Forinstance,London is very busy n large city of uk,everybody is hurry to reach its destination on time,so most people used underground rail in order to avoid traffic.when looking at this example it is obvious that majority public prefer subway to travel as compare to other options of traveling usually in office hours for their comfort as it is an easy to seized facility.thus,it must be concluded day resident especially worker would prefer to take underground for made their journey stress less .\n\nIn addition to this,low cost is the foremost factor for commuter to ride on underground as many companies provide yearly discount packages for their traveling,so large amount of workers took advantage from this schem.if the labour use their own transport to travel to and from work so they have to face many problems like paid parking,traffic congestion n refill fuel.this example clearly shows that why public use local transport rather than their own convince because it safe their money as well as precious time.\n\nAfter analysing the above,it can be concluded that what are the significance of to use public transport over own transport because it protected them financially as well as physically.It is for these reasons I feel that public transport is more comfortable and cost effective."},{"question":"Many museum charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?","answer":"There is a great deal of controversy whether the museums should have entrance fee or they should be allowed free. I believe that accessing the museums with the admission fee s have more benefits than drawbacks. This essay will discuss both the merits and demerits of taking the entrance fee before a conclusion is reached.\n\nThere are several merits of charging the admission fees in the museums. Museums add sources of national economies to the countries. This is because native people, especially tourists, come to visit the museums and spend their money on them. For example, a recent research conducted in Nepal has shown that museums have raised lots of money which ultimately helped in the economic development of Nepal. The other advantage is that costing entrance fee to the people aid in the protection and promotion of the museums. Thus, allowing entrance fees create lots of benefits to countries.\n\nHowever, there are some demerits of charging entry tickets in the museums. Poor people and people from low socio-economic groups couldnt afford to spend their money in the museums. This is due to the fact that they dont have enough money to spend in the museums , instead they have difficulty in fulfilling their basic needs. For instance, Most of the people in Yemen, are living under poverty. They wont have a penny to spend in the museums. Therefore, museums have some drawbacks which some people couldnt afford it.\n\nIn conclusion , Although there are both advantages and disadvantages of charging people with fees in the museums, I am of the opinion that the benefits of it far outweigh the drawbacks. It is hoped that the governments of ones countries should continue it."},{"question":"Watching television is bad for children. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Technological advancement has given the world almost everything. Today people can acquire information about anything from around the globe within a single click. Among them one of the means of transmitting knowledge and information from one place to another is Television. Some people argue that television is harmful to the minor ones. I somehow agree with this notion and this argument will be presented in this essay.\n\nPrimarily, watching television cannot be avoided in this era of global interactions. Spectators watch TV for entertainment, for staying tuned with the latest circumstances around the globe etcetera. In every country something is happening every day. Some countries are struggling with terrorism, such as, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and so forth. Whereas, some populace, in stable conditioned countries, are participating in the prosperity of the human life and advancement of the world even further. Television shows all these pieces of information one after the other. The whole human race is agog in gaining this information and being entertained also. Thus, citizens of all ages keep on watching TV, moreover, it should not be neglected under the light of these reasons.\n\nContrary to this, children do not possess the mental ability of understanding everything on TV. For instance, if there is a documentary in regards to contemporary science ?health, engineering, space etcetera ?children are far away from comprehending this programme. Furthermore, the young generation, that can be observed today, is more interested in watching dramas and other entertainment programmes which is the waste of time to my mind. Children should focus more on their studies rather than killing their time in their TV lounges.\n\nTo sum up, I would reiterate that as children of today are future builders of the human beings. This requires great deal knowledge and creativity. Spending an enormous amount of time before TV cannot help them achieve their goal. Therefore, it is somewhat well said that children and TV shall not be good friends."},{"question":"As people live longer and longer, the idea of cloning human beings in order to provide spare parts is becoming a reality. The idea horrifies most people, yet it is no longer mere science fiction.\nTo what extent do you agree with such a procedure?\nHave you any reservations?","answer":"In todays world, the use of biomedical science at the tissue or cellular level, for the well being of humans is ever increasing. Some believe that the procedure of cloning the whole human body should be done to tackle the ageing process. However, it is disagreed to duplicate individuals for such purpose due to some problems associated with it.\n\nThe biotechnology has been of the utmost importance in the recent past, as it helps in mitigating many effects of life threatening diseases. For instance, the stem cells are parents to any type of cells of the body because they can divide into any specific type. So.these are used to treat the advanced Parkinsons disease to replace the compromised small parts of the brain with healthy cells. Another useful application of this technology is to treat certain types of the blood cancer, by replacing the old bone marrow with the newer one, giving satisfactory results. Hence, this shows that undoubtedly , cloning of cells is fruitful for mankind in many ways.\n\nNevertheless, duplicating of the human body is debatable as there are many ethical and demographic implications related to this. One of them is, it is not socially acceptable for the society to see many look alike copies of the same person because it can be catastrophic. For example, if a clone has committed a crime but the original individual gets captured due to a remarkable similarity between them. then this is not a beneficial aspect of cloning and Therefore, this ethical reason undermines the cloning procedure of humans. In addition, another reservation which comes to mind is the demographic imbalance between the old and the young population, as the reproductive rate will get slower which will burden the global economy with less manpower thus, justifying the cloning only on a cellular level.\n\nHaving discussed reasons in favour of the cellular cloning and against the copying of the human beings, it is clear that there are serious problems associated with this. Although, the stem cell studies should be continued to cure conditions which are not treatable with traditional medical procedures."},{"question":"Government should pay more money on railways rather than roads. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement.","answer":"In the recent years, transportation system is not only getting importance but also developing at a rapid rate. Owing to this reason, Government is also trying to improve transportation system through mega projects on railways and roads. However, the government should work to develop more railways compared to roads. In my opinion, spending on roads would be more beneficial compared to roads. There are many reasons behind this thought and are listed here.\n\nFirstly, roads due to large number of vehicles cause various issues as traffic jam, rush in peak hours, and noise. For example, during the morning time, many people on the roads get stuck due to heavy load of vehicles and also use horn to attain attention of others which cause noise. On the other hand, railways not only avoid nose problem but also cause not traffic jam. \n\nSecondly, railways produce less air pollution compared to vehicles on the roads.

Therefore, government should pay more attention on building railways rather than on roads."},{"question":"Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves.\nUse your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and with relevant evidence.","answer":"Whether prosperous countries should be obligated to spend part of their money to provide necessities of developing countries or underdeveloped countries should be taking care of their own people will be discussed in this essay.\n\nNot all countries across the globe are equally bestowed with the same amount of capital. In fact natural resources, population, environmental conditions are distributed unevenly among the countries making some stand out among others and others to suffer from economic problems. As the world heads toward globalization, it is best interest of the rich countries to provide the poor countries with their needs and help them build their infrastructures so that they can be self-sustained and take steps towards development. For instance, Afghanistan, a war torn and land-locked country, was donated billions of dollars by international community in order to enable it to stand on its feet and fight against universal adversaries and threats.\n\nOthers think that instead of funding other countries, developed countries must spend the amount to make them stronger and create more opportunities. According to them, poverty struck countries are so incapacitated that they will never be able to make a good use of financial aids instead they should themselves fight back and pave the way for the improvement of the situation in the country.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that no single country is able to go through the difficulty the world comes across. For example, if it was not for the aid received by the European countries after World War II from the United States under marshal plan, they tremendously would had to struggle to reach where there are today."},{"question":"many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","answer":"Since the technical revolution took place, media have invaded every house controlling peoples input. One of the themes covered the most by media nowadays is celebrities news. those themes are adopted without consideration of the sake of recipients, especially vulnerable ones such as children. Some people argue that celebrities news do not have that much of impact on children. However, in my opinion, celebrity coverage on media may induce harm to young people in many contexts.\n\nFirstly, famous people covered on news can be bad role models, since youngsters might adapt their misbehavior, such as smoking and consuming alcohol, while they are trying to find ways to deal with life problems. Those acts are widely spreading among young children confirming the fact that many children can be led to the wrong way by only the media.\n\nAnother thing that might be a concern is that young people can create unrealistic ambitions based on their idols. Many children, for example, dream of being football players or singers. That might be to the point they neglect their academic studying for the sake of pursuing their imaginary aspirations, yet only few of them find the talent to reach their dreams. while the majority discovers in a later age that there are more serious ways in life that can be taken by them in order to be successful.\n\nIn short, famous idols covered by media can have their influence on the acts and the ideas of young people. that can be limited, or at least directed, by communicating with children and educating them in order to widen their prospective in life."},{"question":"Advances in science and technology and other areas of society in the last 100 years have transformed the way we live as well as postponing the day we die. There is no better time to be alive than now. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","answer":"In our times, many developments and discoveries have been made leading to great change in all life aspects.Even life spans have increased due to new health technologies. Some people assure that life today is better than ever. However, in my view, those developments have adversely influenced our way of living.\n\nFirstly, new inventions have turned people nowadays into dependent individuals who rely on technology in every detail of their lives. Passive attitude has also resulted from the dependence. Using Auto correction is a good example of that, leading people to rely on computers and smart phones to do such a simple task. This trend can reflect to everyday life acts leaving a negative impact on everyones life.\n\nIn addition, developments in technology have made people increasingly isolated and lacking the essential social nature of humanity. As people depend more on technical ways to contact with each other, such as social media or text messaging, they become increasingly closed and casted away. Some people might even reach the level of sociophobia. This complication is spreading widely today as the usage of technology for communication is becoming more depended on rather than direct contact.\n\nTo sum up, evolution might be for some people a good contribution to our lives, yet these changes have a dark side that has an unfavorable impact on our activeness, and on social life as well. So we should learn how to take control of technology rather than letting technology take control of us in order to maintain a good quality of life."},{"question":"Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","answer":"Learning new languages has always been an important part of everyones education. Yet the right age to start such learning is still debatable. Some people argue that learning languages better begin at older ages as children reach secondary school. However, learning new languages at younger ages starting at primary school seems to be also beneficial in many ways.\n\nOn one hand, starting learning new languages at younger ages do not give the child the opportunity to choose properly which language to choose to study, as they still do not have a clear prospective of what language might they need in their future. Moreover, younger children might not be able to digest some of the complex aspects of these languages such as grammatical rules which can barely be understood by older students.\n\nOn the other hand, it is known that learning process works faster and new information lasts longer if learnt at younger ages. Young children may even have the ability to learn more than one foreign language at the same period. Furthermore, studying languages at younger ages gives children the time to practice as they grow up. Syrian students, for example, who started studying English at primary school, proved to be superior to their peers in English language at secondary school.\n\nTo sum up, although learning new languages at primary school has its negative points, yet those points are still outnumbered by the positive ones. That is why learning foreign languages should be encouraged as it carries more benefit and efficacy than of it at secondary school."},{"question":"Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world.\nDo you think its a positive or nagitive development?","answer":"It is often argued that, due to globalization of the world individuals are able to utilize similar food, clothes and even same medicines, all around the globe. I firmly agree that this is a positive trend, as many advantages are associated with this development and people are more prosperous and healthy due to this.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of this development is that, humans are more healthy than ever because people of different nations are able to use certain medicines, which are only produced in a few countries. If the example of anti Hepatitis C medicine is taken, this treatment was only available in a few developed nations but due to this phenomenon of availability of same pharmaceuticals in all countries, patients in third world countries are also utilizing them for cure. Hence, prevalence of Hepatitis C is much lower compared to the past, which would thus seem to justify that the capacity of people to get similar products in different places of the world is a positive approach to be followed.\n\nIn addition, globalization has created a favourable environment for migrants, provided that they want to live in another country for work or study purpose. As, people feel more comfortable, if they are provided with their traditional or regional food and other cultural belongings in a different city or place, which they can easily buy in their home countries. For instance, in the past only a few Chinese citizens chose to migrate to another country due to the non availability of Chinese food and other native utilities although, now there is a boom of Chinese workers and students in many western countries due to the accessibility of these products, which shows that this phenomenon is fruitful for students and workers. This in turn means that this can also potentially affect global economy in a positive way by reducing unemployment and illiteracy.\n\nHaving discussed reasons why the trend of accessibility of same products in all countries is a positive development. in my opinion, this should be promoted to see better health of humans and to facilitate pupils and workers, in their studies and jobs."},{"question":"The mass media, including television, radio and newspapers, have great influence in shaping people?s ideas. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","answer":"Today, we are living in the modern technological era. Medium is one of its innovative inventions which undoubtedly has a profound effect on making peoples notions. This essay will reach a total consensus with the mentioned statement.\n\nFirst and foremost, people around the globe in every walk of life have a source of media with themselves. If mobile phones are taken as an instance, this would easily be assimilated that in every short while a telemarketing call or text message is received which influences our choice of shopping, acquiring services and so forth. Moreover, if a person surfs the internet, all businesses, political groups, educators and others always remain vigilant enough to appeal people towards them through advertisements.\n\nFurthermore, the media possess the capability to show a hero as a villain and vice-versa. Consequently, today every Muslim is deemed a terrorist or a potential menace to peace. The reason, why the human race thinks in this manner, is the influence of media shaping their minds by articulating this view in diverse articles, programmes, documentaries, news bulletins and so forth. However, Islam has nothing to do with the literature of those who are anti-peace and\/or anti-humanity but politics have. Similarly, the more the business of an entrepreneur is thriving, the more their budget for TV commercials is large, because they know that a minor investment in advertisement can benefit more than double or even more.\n\nIn conclusion, I would strongly suggest that media definitely exert a profound influence on the way we think and react to a particular scenario. Hence, everybody all over the world is busy employing media for attracting flocks of people towards their cause and commercial activities."},{"question":"Currently there is a trend towards the use of alternative forms of medicine. However, at best these methods are ineffective, and at worst they may be dangerous.\nTo what extent do you agree with this statement?","answer":"Complimentary treatments are being practiced and exploited nowadays despite having no approved therapeutic effects yet. In addition, this may cause a serious problem to those utilizing it. Although I agree that these ways of treatment are ineffective, I do not think that considering this as an option may put someones health to peril.\n\nFirst and foremost, the alternative forms of medicine are methods of healing a patients disease or illness without consulting a physician. These are acupuncture, herbalism, and for some are those superstitious beliefs from our ancestors. I have been a Cardiac ICU nurse for more than 2 years already and handled patients who utilized alternative forms of medicine. To give you an example, one of my patients enjoyed acupuncture. Based from his experience, this kind of alternative did not completely take away the pain on his shoulder. However for some reasons, he kept on coming back for acupuncture since it gave a temporary relief from pain and made him relaxed and comfortable.\n\nOn the the other hand, our ancestors have lived longer enough without the acceptable methods of treating illnesses at the present time such as visiting hospitals for consultation, blood extractions to monitor electrolyte levels, undergoing X-rays, CT scans, MRIs and a lot more. When it comes to people living in rural areas, they are still using herbalism to treat their illnesses while other people believes on superstitions like a person has to let a cat scratch his throat when he accidentally ingested a fishbone. Why? It is because these people does not have an easy access to healthcare. These people has not been immersed in modern and technological ways of treating diseases and more often cannot afford to pay hospital bills. Statistically speaking, I havent heard any news yet of someones life put on risk due to these alternative ways of treatment.\n\nTo sum up, although use of alternative forms of medicine are ineffective, considering this as an option may not be dangerous."},{"question":"Nowadays technology is increasingly being used to monitor what people are saying and doing (for example, through cellphone tracking and security cameras). In many cases, the people being monitored are unaware that this is happening. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant example from your own knowledge or experience.","answer":"Today technology has become an inevitable part of our life, although it has made us more susceptible to surveillances without our consent. Technology has been omnipresent nearly in all aspects of our modern life. In spite of making life easier, it has created brand-new problems, being spied on is one among many. In fact, technology has exposed our personal life, taking our privacies away. \n\nSome people believe that in order to have a peaceful live and stay away from criminal and terror threats, mass surveillance should be imposed on all citizens. According to them, it paves the way for the government to easily recognize those threatening the society through criminal actions, for example, the security cameras installed in buildings and stores has prevented about 90% of robberies and if a burglary has been done, it has helped authorities to get the people behind it arrested within the 24 hours of the incident\n\nOn the other hand, another group opposes the idea, claiming that mass surveillance not only has not helped to decrease the crime rates and threats but also has led to blind accusations and arrests, thus, increasing the level of radicalization. Furthermore they believe that living under government?s 24\/7 surveillance make life tougher and more frightening. Provided that these surveillance data gets on the wrong hands, it can undoubtedly put more lives at risk. As an example, covert mass spying on American citizens without them knowing in Obama administration has not resulted in a decline in criminal rates considerably, in contrast, it rose tensions globally among the American allies once it got leaked by the whistle blower, Edward Snowden, the former contractor of National Security Agency (NSA) and risked more American lives. \n\nOn the other hand, as the fact that the world leaders? telephone conversations had been wiretapped by US intelligence agencies revealed, the relationship of US with the world deteriorated causing distrust among the nations.\n\nIn conclusions, I firmly believe that privacy must always be respected and maintained, because everyone has got somethings to keep to themselves, that is why encrypting mobile apps that ensures end-to-end conversation encryptions has attracted public attention. For instance, WhatApp, a popular end-to-end encrypting app has got more than 1 billion users worldwide."},{"question":"Some Universities now offer their courses online so that people can study online. Is this a positive or negative development?","answer":"It goes without saying that these days online education has become commonplace in many Universities. It is generally argued that this advancement could have adverse impacts. I, however, strongly believe that this new way of teaching has fruitful consequences.\n\nTo begin, with this newly growing trend, far more people can get education due to having fewer restrictions. In past, many mature people were not able to study because they were considered over age and do not get enrolled. Similarly, many special people, who need extra amenities at the campus such as elevators, controlled room temperature and like this was failed to attend university. These online courses have allowed to such candidates to acquire quality education without being worried about their age group or physical disabilities. In addition, remote teaching has made learning easy. Online courses, normally, come with flexible timings and people, doing jobs or fulfilling other responsibilities, can study anytime according to their own availability. Some people find it hard to go university owing to lack of appropriate resources, for instance, poor transportation facilities or insufficient capital to spend on. Thus, this is an easy and convenient option for them by all means.\n\nMoreover, this latest teaching methodology has reduced the overall educational cost significantly for educational institutions as well as for pupil. Universities need fewer faculties to teach, small buildings, comparatively less facilities which ultimately alleviate their expenditures, resultantly, they charge less fee to students. Students also save transportation cost and other on campus expenditures such as parking fee, lunch or breakfast money.\n\nTo recapitulate, I claim that online education has several long-lasting benefits for students and institutions."},{"question":"With a fast pace of modern life, more people are turning towards fast food for their main meals. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","answer":"With a proliferation of the number of poeple who have already turned towards junk food for their main meal, it has been leading to some thorny health problems. I totally agree that eating fast food as a main meal is eclipsed by its downsides.\n\nOn the one hand, eating fast food as a main meal can be beneficial in terms of saving money and preparing significantly. Take an example of Russia, where approximately 87% of population tends to eat junk food such as KFC and supposes it is prepared instant and much cheaper than the other food. As this example shows, therefore, people can economize their time and money by eating fast food.\n\nOn the other hand, turning towards fast food for peoples main meal is harmful for their organism. In other words, a nub of the matter is that having junk food begets obesity and people can not stop eating such tasty meals instead of wholesome ones. An excellent example is Canadian inhabitants, who always have a problem of obesity and they may not even avoid this problem by even training. Thus, having fast food as a main part of meal is harmful for peoples health.\n\nTo conclude, the advantages of eating junk food which can save peoples money and time are overshadowed by its drawbacks which begets thorny problems in the case of obesity. It is expected that people will stop eating fast food more often than ever before owing to its impacts on the organisms and health in the foreseeable future."},{"question":"Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","answer":"In todays world, use of automobiles for traveling and transport is ever increasing, which is also responsible for traffic congestion and pollution. Some are of the view that, raising price of petrol is the best solution however, i firmly disagree with this as this model will not work and there are better alternatives to cope with this problem.\n\nIncreasing tax on fossil fuel cannot help in solving growing traffic and pollution related hazards because mostly the people who use vehicles for traveling belongs to the upper income class so, certainly this does not seems to be working in long term. This in turn means that, more money for fuel is not going to pursue them to stop employing cars for their personal use hence, this traffic congestion and air pollution will remain a major hurdle, which would thus seem to justify that further taxation measures on petrol will not discourage automobile users and therefore, other steps should be taken.\n\nNevertheless, policy makers should promote other alternatives, if they want to see fruitful results in the future for both the environment and reducing traffic. There are solutions which are providing mutualistic benefits to both governments and individuals. For instance, if the example of Sweden is taken, this country enacts the use of electrical vehicles by providing free charging spots for these cars, along with reduction of prices for these automobiles. This has consequently, lead to significant decline in carbon dioxide emissions by at least fifty percent. In addition, nations can also cope with growing traffic by providing cheap and environmentally friendly public transport facilities to their citizens such as, Japan, which has shown a remarkable decrease in car ownership in this country thus, advantageous in mitigating pollution and traffic congestion.\n\nHaving discussed reasons why other policies are more effective in reducing pollution and traffic, in my opinion, eco- friendly vehicles and better public transport are far superior in solving these problems instead of more tax on fuel, which is not feasible due to the affordability of most consumers."},{"question":"Crime rate is decreasing compared to the past due to the advance in technology as it can prevent and solve the crime. Do you agree or disagree?","answer":"In the past few years, we have witnessed a significant decline in the number of crimes committed in the society. Many would argue that this phenomenon is attributed to the revolutionary advances in technology taking place nowadays. In my view, I completely agree that technology has greatly contributed to both preventing and solving different crime types.\n\nTechnology has recently contributed to the process of crime prevention. This can be evident by how it significantly reduced the rate by which theft crimes are committed in shops or even houses. Nowadays, for example, every shop in a shopping mall has a security system, comprising of surveillance cameras and sensors, installed. This can help in detection of any unusual activity in the surroundings as well as any strange behavior shown by customers. Hence, technology has further helped to preserve the shops? items on display and additionally, deterred offenders from stealing valuable items and running away with it. Therefore, security cameras can be a very good example of how robbery offences are diminishing as a result of technology.\n\nFurthermore, advances in technology have aided in solving a plenty of crimes such as: abduction and mobile phones? stealing. Offenders kidnapping a victim can now be easily tracked by parents or political authorities, thanks to GPS and other location detection services that are available now on virtually every mobile phone. Similarly, another salient example that holds this theory true is the fact that even stolen mobile phones can be instantly retrieved owing to the updated detection programs and techniques used by police authorities. Thus, there?s no question that solutions to a number of crimes are reached by means of technology.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that if it had not been for the constantly-updated technological breakthroughs, a considerable number of crimes would have passed unsolved and a significant number of offenders would have never been caught."},{"question":"It is better for college students to live far away from home than live at home with their parents. Do you agree or disagree?","answer":"It is argued that it is much more preferable for students of tertiary education to reside far away from their homes. This essay agrees with this notion to a large extent and will provide the reasons to underpin this position. \n\nOn one hand, it is believed by some that living with parents during academic years is way more beneficial than staying far away in college dormitories in light of its cost-effectiveness. In other words, when living with parents, one will not have to shoulder accommodation bills, which is beneficial indeed, as long as currently bills of hostels or accommodations tend to be ?astronomical?. And for this very reason, nowadays some of the students staying in accommodations face serious financial troubles  and have to manage to study and work concurrently, which in turn may result in increased stress levels and poor academic performance. However, if one has enough desire, this is only a matter of patience and determination.\n\nOn the other hand, much closer look on this issue would reveal that the benefits are much more considerable. One, who has decided to live far from home will be exposed to different real-life problems, which is advantageous, since by facing such financial or social issues, he or she will learn how to cope with them without their parents? hands and ultimately will be groomed to adult, independent life. On top of that, those students would have a chance to blend in with people of different socioeconomic, cultural backgrounds and would improve their horizons and interpersonal skills by socializing with them and would be prepared to live in this multi-cultural world. Thus, as is shown living far from home is a hugely useful experience.\n\nAs has been shown, although living far from home has some minor drawbacks such as being subjected to financial challenges, I am of opinion that it is way more beneficial to live far from parents, as students would be poised for independent life and would improve their overall outlooks along with their social skills by meeting people with different backgrounds. Thus, it is hoped that students will start to act wisely and opt to live far away from their homes."},{"question":"Some people think that work is the work is the most important thing of peopleas lives. Without the success of career , life become meaningful.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"It is observed that everyone has their own perspectives about jobs and career.Some believe that meaning of life is only a prosperous career. However, happiness, good health and personal relationships constitute a meaningful life.\n\nAccording to one school of thought ,\" we live once ,we should enjoy our lives to the fullest. \"Generally , for them life is all about a flourishing bank balance and an extravagant lifestyle. In this era of increasing inflation, only a successful career can afford all these luxuries. However, this claim is largely exaggerated. In reality, the beauty of life doesn't lie in these materialistic things; good health , happiness , self satisfaction and loyal relationships are major elements of life. To illustrate this, my friend's uncle is 65- year old retired man ,a successful businessman , who has spent his whole life in building a prosperous career and in doing so he has compromised his health and personal relationships. Now when he wants to enjoy his success , he has been diagnosed with lung cancer. Here a point lies when a person may consider \" what's the point of earning success when good health can't be enjoyed.\"\n\nA further point to be made, longitudinal studies have shown that social and personal relationships, safety, self esteem and self actualization make people feel satisfied. Success in career definitely makes us joyful, but to meet the human fulfilment we need more than that. On an account of this, a housewife considered her success and happiness in looking after her family and raising her children with good moral values, rather than becoming a powerful businesswoman. \n\nIn conclusion , there are sufficient grounds to reject the view that only a successful career can be defined as a having a purposeful life. Money and a career are only small components of life. I believe that self satisfaction , happiness and personal relationships are beautiful colors of our life's canvas."},{"question":"When choosing a job,the salary is the most important consideration.To what extent do you agree or disagree??","answer":"A good employment is the primary requirement for an every individual to lead a good standard of life.Nowadays, choosing a job revolves around many factors . Amongst them money is considered to be a major influencing factor.I agree to a greater extent for the above notion because of numerous reasons which will be discussed in this essay.However, factors such as interest and passion towards job also plays a pivotal role in considering a job which cannot be neglected.\nMoney is the basic requirement for any human to survive.\n\nTo begin with, the cost of living has been drastically increased over the years and everyone wants to live a luxurious life with all comforts.This in turn makes an individual to naturally opt for a job with better salary irrespective of their interest.To exemplify,right from education to health service money plays a vital role,proving that it s an important factor for human to meet their basic requirements in their day to day life.Hence it is clear that if a person opts a job according to his interest, there will be many people suffering from poverty.\n\nDespite this, there are some imperative factors such as passion and job-satisfaction that cannot be neglected.An individual who selects a job according to his interest will work effectively.As a result the productivity of company will be enhanced, which will grant him promotions and salary hikes. Therefore, it is obvious that a person who is passionate about their work will not only earn lot of money but also fetch him peace of mind and job-satisfaction.Hence, being passionate about his work will make his carer more successful, which will eventually make him rich.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the fact that money is being the basic essence of life for survival , I agree to greater extent that salary will be given first preference for selecting a job.However, factors such as interest ,passion etc that gives job-satisfaction cannot be downplayed."},{"question":"Without capital punishment ( the death penalty ) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"A death penalty as a way of declining bloodshed criminality in community has always been a prior topic for governments. Some people think that it is the most favorable preventive law, while others argue that it is unjust in terms of taking second chances to be a good citizenship in future.\n\nOn the one hand, despite tough laws required by governments an average number of crimes is ascending. A law requiring only some years of imprisonment, but no death sentence for offence contributes the criminal violence. The probability to be put to capital punishment may threat people and create safer society to live. \n\nOn the other hand, every criminal should be provided with second chance no matter what type of crime he committed and what punishment he has been sentenced. Executive bodies have to be engaged in releasing such lawbreakers into society. Numerous examples can be presented when wrongdoers mend their ways after having been sentenced. Moreover, there is no credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the number of homicides. In contrast, the average number of crimes in countries embracing capital punishment is more than those which abolish it. Therefore, a death penalty is not the mere solution to deter the increasing trend of crimes in a society.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that capital punishment builds a secure community, it may contribute to the emperor of fear as well. It is predicted that the more strict laws are imposed, the more people are inclined to commit a crime of violence."},{"question":"Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve trafficand pollution problems.to what extent do you agree or disagree?\nwhat other measures do you think might be effective?","answer":"The primary solution to the ever-increasing problems of traffic and pollution resides in hiking the price of the most commonly used fuel,petrol.However,I am of the view that this might not be the best of dealing with these issues on account of the ineffectiveness and potentially damaging side effects of this step. \n\nIt is clear that the people who support increasing the price of petrol forget that it will do little to curb the rapid industrialization process and booming car numbers, responsible for the rising pollution and traffic woes respectively.In case such a measure is taken ,cars would simply switch to another fuel,such as natural gas and ,as for industries, most of them don't use petrol as a basic fuel.Hence, traffic and pollution woes would not be significantly affected by raising the price of petrol.\nIn addition, associated with rising petrol prices are wide-ranging and damaging implications on the most crucial and vulnerable component of the society,the common man.Once petrol's value goes up,so will the cost of petroleum products, which practically includes most of the things used in the daily life of an average person.As a result, daily living expenses of the average person will skyrocket.Therefore,instead of pollution and traffic,the common man will be affected the most.\n\nNevertheless, several alternatives can be employed to alleviate the pollution and traffic problems.To begin with, laws should be introduced and strictly implemented to regulate industrial waste products,this would really limit the pollution industries would cause.Finally,improving the transport infrastructure as well as a subways and bus network, working in tandem, would markedly lessen traffic problems.\n\nTo conclude, an increase in the price of petrol is a reckless move which ,apart from hurting an average individual,would not lessen the traffic and pollution problem.these issues are better solved by steps such as regulation of industry through legislature and better transport infrastructure."},{"question":"Governments spend a lot of money on national celebrations such as national holidays and public festivals. Some people say the government spend too much on this and that they should use this money on other useful things. Do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Public celebrations are an important aspect in any country, some people however frown at the huge amount of funds governments put into celebrating such events like national holidays. To this opinion, I strongly subscribe. This essay will cross examine this subject and climax with a reasonable conclusion.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that some dates are worth remembering, especially as they serve as veritable tools in transmitting cultural heritages of any nation. Therefore, posterity is reminded of the values a particular country holds dear. Take South Africa as an example, the Nelson Mandela day is celebrated to commemorate the struggles South Africans went through in securing freedom from apartheid.This has helped the modern day youth to realise that freedom comes with a price and should not be taken or granted.\n\nGranted that some festivals are worth celebrating, it is however pertinent to note that an alarming amount of money is spent to do so at the perils of other sectors of a country. The money spent on a single day to mark an event can easily be channeled into other areas like health and education that will have a greater impact on the lives of the citizens of any country. To illustrate this point, consider Nigeria, a country that spent 250 billion US dollars on celebrating her 'National Democracy Day'. This amount of money is twice that needed to transform her health sector which is in complete shambles. Spending so much money is thus not beneficial when a country has other grave needs yearning to be met.\n\nIn a nutshell, I strongly agree to the fact that too much funds are being spent by the government on national celebrations such as national holidays and festivals Although certain dates serves to transmit culture and are worth marking, the cost of doing so should be reduced so that other areas of the country's economy can grow."},{"question":"Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient.\nOther people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful.\nWhat is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.","answer":"People have different viewa according to the rule of computers in our lives.Some claim that they facilitate our lives, whilst others think that they are making life more difficult and stressful. I advocate that computers have improved our life since their invention.This essay will analyze my opinion.\n\nIn Recent years ,technological development has changed people`s life.One of the most beneficial technological equipment is the computers.Many individuals have depended on the computers in almost their entire life.There are various uses of them in different life fields.For instance,computers are impacting in government`s security system.Authorities have multiple security institutes and special offices which contain certain technological devices including computers.Many cardinal databases are in these computers,therefore ,when authorities need any information about any resident in this country,they will extract it from the saved data on these computers.\n\nIn addition to it`s rule in security system,community can get benefit from computers in the social communications. Nowadays,social media affectss most of people`s life style such as their way of living and their communications with each otherand their loved ones.Computers make the contact between individuals easier through social media.\n\nFinally,computers help many members of any society in their education.Recently,universities are depending more on the online learning and support many people in different ages to get their education through internet based education to pursue their career progression.For example, my uncle who is 60 years old get his master degree in parasitology through an intensive online course and this assists him to get higher salary in his work.\n\nTo conclude, although some people think that computers has made our life more competitive and stressful,I believe in my personal perspective that computers have a substantial benefits in any community."},{"question":"Television is dangerous because it has destroyed the family living and communication. Some people say that it absorbs people\u2019s time too much that they have no time to talk to each other. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"I somewhat agree with the idea that TV is harmful to humankind and it has resulted in ruining the family life and interaction among them. Moreover, it is asserted by some people that TV wastes great deal of time, therefore, people fall short of time to communicate with each other.\n\nThe present era is the most innovative because of the wonderful inventions. TV is mostly proposed for debates and the debaters argue that our family life is destroyed and it is also causing us lack of interaction with the globe. Massive TV programmes present vulgar and obscene material for rating and their revenue generation which undoubtedly have dire consequences for family living. Furthermore, the couch potatoes keep on wasting their time before TV and stay away from engagement in social situations.\n\nConversely, TV is not the only invention of this modern era. Users around the globe are always busy with the social networking websites, namely; Facebook, Twitter, Instegram, YouTube and many others. In the case of family values and communication among them, these social networking sites play a vital role in segregating us from each other and the family living falls in value due to indecent material available on them. Therefore, I suggest that not only TV is responsible for the disastrous consequences. For instance, there are groups on Facebook with thousands of members that entertain users with ties of friendship services, which devalues the adult education and modesty of users. Hence, they never care for family living and communication with their loved ones.\n\nTo conclude, I would reiterate that merely television should not be blamed for the catastrophic family life of populace today. If we sustain the overall media as a part of our life and the modern inventions and advancements continue to take place, this world can experience poor family values and lack of communication among people even further."},{"question":"Schools are spending more time teaching traditional subjects such as history. Some people think they should rather spend more time in teaching skills that can help students find a job. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"It is commonly believed by many people that traditional method of teaching subject\u2019s like history in schools is the most recommended one. Though there are other people who disagree with the idea and believes in developing skills in children. In my opinion, I completely agree with the fact that developing skills at the very early stages of learning in schools will definitely help beginners to get good job in future.\n\nFirstly, schools are the first learning site for young children so whatever guidance is given from there children will follow them. Secondly, giving proper orientation to skill building in schools not only help young minds to select the one they are best at but also help them in choosing their careers. Like for example, if a young child interested in painting is motivated at school for building his painting skills, he will surely become artist in future.\n\nAnother point that one can made is that schools are always famous for building competition skills. As students learn different skills they will start competing with each other and finally will become more and more brighter at the one they have learnt. In other words, it will help them in securing their future by getting a handsome salary job.\n\nAt present, most of the schools are spending ore time on teaching simple literature subjects like history or geography though they can be easily learnt at home by giving simple assignments. Therefore, valuable classroom\u2019s time can be spent in a much more productive way. In this way, children will also get a chance to learn from each other.\n\nIn conclusion, the most efficient and easiest way of utilization of time in schools is by skill building. It will give individual the future directions for his career."},{"question":"Some people believe that it is wrong to give homework to students. Some argue that extra study is beneficial for their future.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"The practice of homework has been now a subject of severe criticism in educational fields. Many people criticize this kind of academic imposition upon students to be unnecessary pressure. However, the supporters of homework consider it as an essential part of educational activity. Personally, I strongly opine that pupils should excluded from home tasks, they should be provided freedom to study according to their interests.\n\nIn one perspective, relaxation in home based study system allows the learners to spend their time with their comfortable ways which denote that they can educate themselves in their self-motivated fields of knowledge. For instance,if these youngers are released from the regular pressure of home tasks,they would have got the freedom to think of their creative fields such as Albert Einstein,Isaac Newton and Bill Gates. Sorrowfully,the constant pressure on child-psychology makes them just to cram and deliver their limited knowledge which they receive from homework without any self-interest.\n\nAnother reason to remove this inappropriate practice from national education curriculum is that almost all the learners forget the works completely which they do to be homework at any level of education. If all learners lose all information or knowledge whatever they are taught painstakingly from institutions,then why that teaching should be followed that is completely illogical. On the other hand, those knowledge which a person learns with self-motivation, are proved to be very cogent and cognitive. Consequently,these learners can accomplish in their fields. Thus,self education and freedom of thinking out of framework set up by school are more legible for collective flourish in knowledge.\n\nTo conclude, though framed school work can input some information into the brain of the pupils. However, the freedom of self-education must be prioritized too for making outstanding individuals."},{"question":"Most countries want to improve the standard of living through economic development; however, others think the social value is lost as a result. \nDo you think that advantages of economic development outweigh the disadvantages?","answer":"Presently, states are increasing the living standard of their nationals from financial growth. Conversely, some impugned that this trend is damaging the communal structure of the modern society. It is argued that economical advancement has more benefits than the drawbacks. Support of this opinion will be shown by looking at the employment opportunities and infrastructure development.\n\nFirstly, fiscal progress has produced numerous jobs for professional people. This is because financially stable country is profitable for investors and this will bring (FDI) Foreign Direct Investment for the establishment of industries. For example, a research conducted by the Royal Institute of London has shown in recent report that migration of skilled workers is rising dramatically, because economical steady states are providing secured workplace to the skilled immigrants. This example makes it clear that for career enlargement skillful people are leaving their families and their culture for secured future. Thus, the theory of giving priority to the capital evolvement on personal and public values is difficult to debunk.\n\nIn addition, commercial enhancement is establishing the advance infrastructure for the dwellers, because availability of funds in state is plausible for improvement of basic facilities. For instance, America has highest growing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio. It is possible due to endowment in modern transport system, health sector and education. It makes obvious that stability in exchequer is producing positive ramifications for every native. Hence, the heightened benefits regarding the monetary progression on collective values can clearly be seen.\n\nTo reiterate, after analyzing the pros of finance, in my view, it can be concluded that fruitful results of fiscal augmentation has outweighed the shortcomings in this trend. It is expected that stringent steps should be taken from state authorities for capital development."},{"question":"Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement\nTo what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?","answer":"Recycling arguably reduces our non-biodegradable wastes and simultaneously enhances our nature. Myriad individuals assume that not enough of the recyclable materials from household wastes are being recycled. Concurrently, they deem that the only means to expand the recycling method is for the governments making it a legal requirement.\n\nBased on my personal perspective, I presume that it has an abundant advantages if it becomes mandatory. Generally, we utilize daily an enormous amount of stuffs that can be recycled, like bags, beverage cans and bottles, and plastics. Human creates a sizable amount of trash everyday, which can result an appalling environment in upcoming future. Experts convey that recycling have a significant aid in reducing our dirt.\nApparently, numerous people are not able to recycle their own waste because of various reasons. One obvious reason is they are busy with their jobs and schools and have not enough time to do their choir.\n\nMoreover, several individuals are just not willing to involve with the procedure.Therefore, making it compulsory will probably increase the involvement of many individuals. And eventually can reduce our rubbish extensively. Majority of us are afraid of the consequences of the penalty if we don't comply in certain law. Thus, countless citizens will ought to obey it and eventually raise the participation in recycling process.\n\nIn conclusion, I reckon that if government makes the recycling prerequisite, remarkable modification will happen to our habitat. Furthermore, this is for the benefits of us and our next generation. I deem that a healthy and delightful scenery contribute to our high quality life."},{"question":"Consumer goods have become the most important part of people's lives. Do the advantages outweigh disadvantages?","answer":"With our world turning into a consumer-driven society, many people have long been placing a high value on consumer goods. As a result, these products have already become a significant part of our lives. This essay will show that the benefits of this exceed its drawbacks.\n\nThere are many downsides to having a consumer society, among which the primary one is that as the demand for a wide variety of goods is increasing, a lot of businessmen are now willing to make their products available at any cost. As a result, some traders have, so far, been smuggling contraband goods which leaves them in breach of the law, thus causing the loss of a colossal amount of money. However, as it could be controlled over by calling for tighter regulations, governments of every stripe can successfully cope with this problem.\n\nThose opposed to this say that having consumer goods as a vitally important part of our lives is wildly beneficial to the economy of any country. This is primarily because, it is consumers who demand goods and services, hence ensuring that a large number of people get employed by businesses producing necessary goods for customers. \nApparently, if it were not for the goods or services demanded, many people would now be out of work. For example, consumer spending on goods and services makes up nearly 70% of the GDP of the USA. Apart from this, customers currently have a tremendous amount of choice in the marketplace where there is a stunning range of products under many different names which makes big businesses tons of money. Thus, it is clear that a rampant consumerism, by its very nature, works very well for capitalists, economists and corporations.\n\nOn balance, although living in a consumer society may needlessly result in the sales of illegal goods, the demerits of a consumerism are overshadowed by its merits in light of job opportunities it offers and the benefits it brings to the economy of the particular country."},{"question":"Prevention is better than cure\".Out of country's health budget,a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on preventive measures. \nTo what extend do you agree?","answer":"Health related problems have always been a centre of focus for all the societies.I believe the old is saying certainly true; \"prevention is better than cure \".It is strongly recommended that money should be mainly invested in preventive measures rather than treatment and investigations of the diseases.\n\nFirst of all, treatment and investigation of a disease is undoubtedly an expensive process.Medicines are very costly and the tests advised by the doctor are even more.Not only this,hospital admission fee consumes a huge amount of money.However,if all this money is spent on those measures that can help prevent the illness, the result would be far better.And also, these measures do not require a handsome amount of money.Take diabetes as an example,the ways in which people can protect themselves against it are quite simple and cheap.Doing regular excercise and consuming a low-calorie diet is a solution to prevent it.Hence, it is evident that spending money on preventing measures is enormously beneficial when compared to spending on treatment of a disease.\n\nSecondly, money spent on treatment is sometimes virtually wasted as many diseases do not even respond to medications.Looking in detail, there are many serious complications that arise as a result of a particular disease,that cannot be sometimes cured even with costly medicines.Lung Cancer illustrates an excellent example of such cases.People suffering from this cancer have to undergo various dangerous procedure and need extremely expensive medicines.But, despite this recovery rate is very low.On the contrary,if all this money is spent on preventive steps such as, raising awareness about harmful effects of smoking,people would avoid smoking.\n\nTo conclude, the best way to fight any disease is by investing in its prevention.Once some acquires an illness,it becomes difficult to treat it and afford all the expenses."},{"question":"Some people think that it would be better for large companies and industry to move to regional areas outside large urban centers. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","answer":"It is widely believed that it is more favorable for big industrial firms to relocate their business from urban to rural areas. This essay will first demonstrate that an analysis of how the primary disadvantage associated with a poor internet connection, is not valid, followed by the major advantages such as the possibility of employing rural job seekers for lower salaries and the availability of raw materials to show that the drawbacks of this are overshadowed by its benefits.\n\nThere are certain drawbacks that the idea of transferring business brims with. The primary downside is that the Internet connection in a new area may be so unreliable that the trades of a company can be adversely affected. In other words, many companies located outside the large city centers might find it difficult to advertise their products online due chiefly to the limited internet access. However, if there are some other means of spreading their goods, it is only a matter of finance to advertise.\nThose opposed to this say that it is wildly beneficial for large organizations to move outside the cities. This is mainly because, if companies were situated outside the metropolitan area, this would mean that those firms would have an opportunity to hire local job hunters for the lower amount of wage, which would inevitably benefit both people and companies, thus reducing the unemployment rate. \n\nApart from this, an easy access to the raw materials available in the rural areas can be an additional benefit since the organizations would have raw material surpluses. For example, one of the international companies called Aramark had to relocate its headquarters outside of Philadelphia and that turned out to be an ideal location as it offered a direct access to a wood that could have been unavailable in their previous location. Therefore, it makes sense for many businesses to be situated nearer their required sources.\n\nAs has been shown, although having access to the Internet could be challenging, the demerits of relocating larger industrial firms outside the towns are eclipsed by its merits on account of the potential benefit for staff and a strong accessibility to basic materials."},{"question":"Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\nWhat other measures do you think might be effective?","answer":"It is argued that a rise in the price of fuel can resolve the problem of the increasing volume of traffic and pollution issues. This essay disagrees with this statement and will provide reasons to prove this along with outlining some ways, which could help to combat the very issue.\n\nAutomobiles have already become an integral part of our lives. However, there are some serious problems, which these vehicles have been posing for us and our ecology (namely pollution and traffic congestion). And inflated price of petrol would not cope with these phenomena in the long term, since people taking up higher positions in a social escalator will not stop using cars just because of higher excises duties on gas and will anyway continue employing automobiles for personal use. Therefore, rising taxes on petrol would not discourage automobile users and issues in question would remain unsolved.\n\nThere are many ways of tackling pollution and traffic problems. One way of addressing these issues could be promoting environmentally friendly types of public transportation (such as trains, trolleys and underground railway). For instance, Seoul (South Korea) had been suffering from \u2018bumper-to-bumper\u2019 traffic on roads, before the government invested a large sum of money in improving public transportation system (2006). As a result, carbon emissions of this country have been reduced significantly (by roughly 10 metric tons). Besides, there has been a marked decrease in rates of car ownership in this country. Thus, encouraging usage of public transport can yield much better results. \n\nTo conclude, high tax on petrol does not seem to work due primarily to people from higher-income class, for whom money is not an issue. And in my view, promoting eco-friendly public transport could bear fruit in solving horrendous traffic congestion and pollution problems."},{"question":"In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, these developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive in future.\nTo what extent do you agree with this view? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.","answer":"The last two decades have seen enormous developments if the IT sector, it has affected peoples\u2019 way of lives. Although these developments have many positive sides, it can be argued that in future IT will bring it with more negative things than positive on human society.\n\nTo begin with, email has made communications easier and faster than traditional letters were used to in past. As a result, business and commerce are enjoying numerous benefits. Moreover, World Wide Web means we can get information we wish to. For example, people can get news, online education course, read e-books so on. As this example shows, it can be seen that these improvement will make our lives easier and more convenient, and it future it will be continued.\n\nHowever, there might be several negative effects these improvements derive. For example, many people think, communicating by email is destroying the way of traditional communications including letter writing, telephone and face-to-face conversation. This could result in a decline in peoples\u2019 basic ability to interact with each other on a daily basis.\n\nIn addition to this, the large size of the Web has meant that it is nearly impossible to regulate and control. This is the reason for which many people think children might explore unsuitable sites that play negative role on their minds and health. Unfortunately, in future this kind of problem might get worse than now, if it is not strictly monitored.\nTo sum up, improvements in IT sectors have brought many benefits to us. However, I think, new technology will bring more negative things to individuals and society if we fail to address the demerits related to this advancement in IT."},{"question":"Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this Is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","answer":"It is a painful truth that many native Languages are in the brink of extinction today. Languages are verbal communications between different sectors of people in a community, but over time most of the rare dialects were replaced by common languages. Few individuals believe that extinction of many languages from the past is a trivial issue to ponder about, because the lesser the languages used to communicate, comfortable would be the existence. I do not support this view and strongly believe that languages should\u2019nt die out from this world because they have so much to offer. I substantiate my idea by providing two reasons which are,preserving rich heritage and increasing employability.\n\nTo begin with individual languages represent a legacy of a society. It depicts the style of living, tradition and beliefs of our ancestors which we take forward through generations. It helps us to understand the history of various cultures which could be written in the native writing. If languages disappear, we can never connect with the cherished inheritance of our fore fathers, so it is our at most responsibility to preserve the languages from vanishing totally. For example, in India, different states are divided based on specific languages which carry a unique inheritance and we celebrate it every year on specific dates, like \u201ckannada rajyostava\u201d in Karnataka, during which time special songs and plays are run in kannada about our royal karnataka history.Therefore I absolutely feel ,languages should not die out because they carry valuable heritage with them. \n\nIn like manner, knowing different languages is beneficial for each and every individual, because it paves way for innumerable job opportunities all over the globe. People who are enthusiastic to learn new languages along with their mother tongue, are likely in a position to communicate with various sectors of people both with in and outside their country for exchange of ideas, knowledge, skills and culture, thereby adding an instant boost to their resume and future job prospects. On the contrary, language barrier puts the same person in a enclosed space with no interaction with the outside world which is very detrimental for personal growth on the whole. For instance, for professionals like doctors knowing multiple languages is very helpful in their day to day interaction with their patients adding extra weightage to their repertoire .Therefore I strongly feel dialects shouldnot perish as they increase novel job opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, conserving unique legacy and improving job prospects are the two main factors which prove to show that, we definitely have to preserve several dying languages in the present time.I strongly disagree with the argument stated in the question and feel that languages have to be saved from extinction .This constructive attitude will not only bring progress in today's society but also in the future endeavours."},{"question":"Some people say that in all levels of education, from primary schools to universities, too much time is spent on learning facts and not enough on learning practical skills.\nDo you agree or disagree?","answer":"It is argued that the curriculum of formal education system is based more on theoretical aspects of knowledge than focusing of skills that require in practical life. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement. In this essay, I am going to examine some of the key aspects pertaining to the statement and try to explain my position about the matter.\n\nThe main objective of education, in my views, is to create good citizens who will contribute to the advancement of the society as well as develop him of herself. Our education system at the primary and high school level provide the students with basic knowledge base like science, math, history etcetera. These are basically abstract, with limited practical activities. Besides, students get involved with applied form of knowledge at the university level by doing research or assignments. \n\nBesides, technical education like medical or engineering studies involved a lot of practices as it require. It is clear that education system take the students into the different stages of knowledge ranging from abstract to practical form. Moreover, vocational education provides the students technical knowledge which are more practical skills based. This corroborates the position that education system is designed for the best way to meet the needs of the society.\n\nOn the other hand, people who think that education is burdened with unnecessary facts and figures argue that students spend too much time dealing with abstract things which are of no use in practical life. Instead, they should in their daily lives.\n\nIn conclusion, it cannot be ignored that experience and knowledge that the human race have created so far are passed through education from one generation to another generation for this, it must contain abstract facts, theories and figures."},{"question":"One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing.\nDo you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages ?","answer":"For centuries, humankind has been searching ways to live longer and thanks to advancement in medical field, mortality rate has plunged down and people are experiencing better longevity. This improvement has brought a lot of advantages with few disadvantages which will be discussed in below paragraphs followed by a conclusion. \n\nOn the one side, progression in medical field have improved life expectancy, but that at the cost of quality of life. This is because, people are living up to 100 years , but with the help of medical equipment\u2019s or expensive medicines which put alot of pressure on family members. Also, government have to keep more budget for senior citizens in the form of old- age homes, pensions which can be used on other critical issues like employment generation . For instance, the government of India has allocated around 22% of budget for senior citizens for 2017, as the percentage of senior citizens have shot up. \n\nHowever, not all old people feel ill, and they can enjoy a healthy lifestyle if they keep themselves fit. People are much fitter now as compared to their ancestors and they explore many new places which they could not do in young age, due to a lot of commitments. Also, if they save a lot of money for their retirement life, they cannot be a burden on their family or government. Also they can help to babysit their grandchild which is an added advantage to working parents.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that proper planning at young age like keeping enough money for later life and maintaining a healthy lifestyle helps to enjoy better life and they don\u2019t have to rely on their offerings nor on the government, as they are independent and free from diseases and ready to enjoy later life."},{"question":"Nowadays young people lack an understanding of how to manage their finances after they finish high school.Explain why they do no know how to manage money and how this can be changed.","answer":"In this contemorary world,youngsters do not know about money management skills after completing their higher school studies. Therefore,i think the main reason of this is that these skills are not taught in higher secondary schools and thats why should be practiced at this level in order to prepare them for their future.\n\nTo begin with,after school,many children leave their home and move to far away cities to pursue higher education.Unless,they know how to spend their money,they will soon run out of funds and put them and their faimly in trouble.If they learn money management at school this would not happen.Furthermore,a lot of children especially those coming from rich faimlies, recieve generous amount of pocket money. many of them waste this money on unneccessary things because they do not understand or appreciate the value of money.If money management is part of the curriculum, they will learn to use it judiciusly.this learning will stand them in good stead throughout their life.\n\nSimilarly,since we need money to buy essential items and to lead a comfertable life,money management skills are crucial for our overall well-being and happiness.There is no right or wrong time to learn a skill,even so,the sooner we start the better.Today 's children are tomorrow's adults.If they learn essential life skills today,it will benefit them and their country now and in future.Last but not the least,money management lessons may also improve the arithmetical skills of young people.\n\nIn summary,developing the foundation is crucial for any learning abd having money management as a subject will definitely prepare young people for their future."},{"question":"Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential increasing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.","answer":"In the recent decades, international conflicts have been becoming more frequent between nations due to that in some cases, residents ejaculate their emotions in a wrong way. Although some people argue that common sports events encourage to make worse the conflicts, this essay will introduce some reasons why these events are so essential to ease the conflicts and come out patriotism in a right way. \n\nAdvocates of the idea that these festivals such as the football world cup, Olympic game and so forth mention it would create much pressure for nations, residents, athletes, and others. Taking Korea and Japan as an example, having the strongest football teams in Asia, their football matches are vital for residents, fans, and all individuals. This is because it is not only sport but also protect their precise. In the mid-1990, these teams matched regularly, and as a result, the Korean team vanquished, and unfortunately, two or three days later, some players of the Korean team was suffered from invisible odds. Of course, this event made tensions between the two nations worse, and that\u2019s why it increases some tensions. \n\nHowever, I always hope that these events can play an important role in reducing tensions and raising patriotism. They give some continents to deeply understand to each other. For instance, in the mid-1990, North Korea visited South Korea with fans, and actually, this match was significant for South Korea because if South Korea win, it will participate the football world cup. Interestingly, during the match, though South Korean fans supported the team to beat, North Korean fans scouted and cried. It means that North Koreans are a normal fan of the sport. After that, the political and ideological tensions between the two Koreas reduced, resulting in the increase in the number of tourists from North Korea to South Korea and from South Korea to North Korea. Then, with helping of sports, some nations can become closer to others, and the sports give them an excellent chance to realize that they are one nation. \n\nTo sum up, although sports events lead some harmful effect to accelerate tensions and come out patriotic feelings in a wrong way, they play a key role to ease tensions as respecting each other, and give us to release safely the emotions because it can be easily observed from the case of the two Koreas."},{"question":"Celebrities make a very good living out of media attention and have chosen to live in the public spotlight.\nThey have no right to complain when they feel the media are intruding on their privacy.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","answer":"Literally speaking, media interference in private life of famous people is a hot discussion at many platforms. Some people assert that they earn a great deal of money by showing their presence under spotlight. In my perspective, I agree with the statement that the role of media is to highlight celebrities but they don\u2019t have a right to interfere in their private life. Firstly, this essay will discuss how media exposure helps well-known people for their better life. Secondly, unethical practices of media will be explored further before reaching a final verdict. \n\nOn the one hand, every individual wants to grow in their career. Media presence is an essential career growth factor for any celebrity. For instance, Silvester Stallion is a famous Hollywood movie star but nowadays his media presence is almost negligible so he is no more considered as a superstar. Furthermore, media presence help movie stars to earn supplemental income by endorsing any brand or act in any commercial advertisement. For example, a famous Pakistani actor Mahira khan endorse, worldwide, famous brand Lux. Media\u2019s role is crucial for famous people\u2019s career if it adopts ethical practices.\n\nOn the other hand, every person performs different kinds of activities in their professional and personal life. It is an unethical practice if the media shows well-known person\u2019s personal life. For example, a strong movie star in a film perform stunts that he cannot perform in real life. And, in actuality he may not perform the same. So, if media highlight his weaknesses his career might get affected. Furthermore, media can ruin any celebrity\u2019s image by showing his personal life activities. In past, many sportspersons were charged for using drugs.\n\nIn conclusion, without putting himself under a spotlight any celebrity cannot succeed in his career. However, media must perform ethically by segregating their personal and professional life."},{"question":"Differences between countries become less evident each year. Nowadays, all over the world people share the same fashions, advertising, brands, eating habits and TV channels.\nDo the advantages of this trend outweigh the advantages?","answer":"With the passage of each year, the dissimilarities between states are becoming less apparent. This enhancement has resulted in the sharing of similarity in fashion statement, advertisement, branding, eating endeavors and selection of TV channels across the globe. In my perspective, the drawbacks of this development are eclipsed by its benefits and support of this opinion will be presented with elaborations to justify my inclination in the succeeding paragraphs of this essay, followed by a conclusion.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of adopting identical culture is that creation of sense of harmony and brotherhood in people living in different states. To be more precise, similarity in different trades like (fashion, marketing, trademark, dine in practice and TV stations) will definitely remove feeling of inequity and prejudice from countries. For example, people in European countries are like minded in choosing wardrobes, advertising the product, consuming brands, having identical meals and watching same shows. Moreover, this uniformity can help citizens to settle and migrate in other countries. This is possible because indistinguishable traditions are practiced worldwide and people travelling to a new place can settle easily. A good illustration is Asians taking status of PR (Permanent Residency) in Canada and Australia, and they are spending their life normally because of equal customs. People living in this region are following western ethos because they were using alike norms in their state.\n\nConversely, one of the major the drawbacks of this trend is ancestral traditions and uniqueness in culture will disappear from this planet and history is not going to distinctive behavior of different nations. For instance, in Pakistan youngsters prefer to wear western clothes, using brands like Prada, Nike and Next, eating pizzas, fast food and viewing famous TV shows like GOT (Games of Thrones). They are giving priority to western society on their forefather traditions which is demerit, because there will be no difference in nations. However, this problem can be surmounted easily, if elders teach young people to adopt balance in life, and they should not forget their own ethnicity with trending culture. Therefore, negative ramification of this revolution is solvable.\n\nIn conclusion, in the light of aforementioned paragraphs, I strongly agree that positives side of same trend propagated worldwide outlaws the disadvantages."},{"question":"Most artists earn low salaries and should therefore recieve funding from the government in order for them to continue with their work. To what extent doyo u agree or disagree.","answer":"It is argued that artists earn less money and therefore the government is ought to provide subsidies to them. This essay agrees with the before mentioned notion because the media network is the significant field of interest and has deficit number of platforms to display art.\n\nAdmittedly, film and music industries play a significant role in entertainment of a country. However, the profit the actors get are negligible because there is no offical criteria of monthly payments. In other words, most of the actors suffer hardships in getting payments until they become well renowed. For example, in Bangladesh there are quite a few cases of sucides of performers because of due checks since two or three years which leaded them in proverty and depression to end their life. Hence, governments taking care of this arts would be essential for the sustance of such actors.\n\nMoreover, performing industry in many places around the world suffers a lot mainly due to social restrictions. It means that the actors are not given better opportunities to express in various stages to contribute in the media stream; there hard struggles are sacrificed by the social norms. Take saudia arabia for example, the government allowed no cinema or music concert which resulted in countable musicans and actors with no appreciation. As a result, 90 per cent of them migrated to other countries with no cultural restrictions. Thus, governments support can effectively resolve the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, I concur with the statement that government support is one of a essential criteria for the well being of arts industry, as many of the individuals linked to this industry lack money which is the basic neccessity given after work. It is recomended that more governments should take the initiative of financially backup the art performers."},{"question":"More and more people are suffering from health problems caused by modern lifestyle which cannot be treated with modern medicine. Some people think that a return to traditional medicine should be encouraged. Do you agree or disagree??","answer":"In the 21st century, modern lifestyle is responsible for increase the health problems among the individuals which cannot be prevented by current antibiotics . while some people believe that conventional medicine should be replaced by the new antidotes. I strongly agree with this phenomenon and I am going to give the reasons and examples in the upcoming paragraphs.\n\nThe very first reason why I agree with this proposal is that the old medicines have less expensive than the modern antibiotics and every person can easily afford to buy it. For example a survey was conducted by Punjabi University of Patiala in 2005 was that modern medicine is 4 times expensive than ancient medicines. Another important point is considered that it is also available in every market of nation so that people do not need to travel to other country to purchase it.\n\nAnother point should be born into mind that tradition medicine is more effective and it finish the diseases from Roots whereas modern medicine has prevent the ailments for short time period. conventional medicine can be prepared by experienced person at home with Herbs and Woody tissues. additional e it has no side effect for health and people can used it without any fear.\n\nBefore putting my pen down , I would like to say that people should be aware about their health and use the traditional homeopathic medicine instead of current antidotes."},{"question":"Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Since globalization, poverty has become an alarming issue, and for this reason, people have a wide spectrum of opinions about how to combat this problem. Among those, the most proposed idea is to hire proficient professionals from the under-privileged country by the wealthy nations. I strongly agree with this notion because of its various advantages which can greatly impact on both countries functional identity to the world.\n\nIdeally, unemployment is the prime contributor to the poverty of a country.By enhancing job prospects for the skilled labor force from the under-developed country, the affluent countries can facilitate those states way to build up a strong economy, which in turn, will help them to grapple with poverty.This can only be attained by that workforce who repatriate the portion of their remuneration to the homeland, which consequently, incorporates in the persistent long-term development of those poor nations.By investing these additional revenues, what comes from that remittance, in other sectors like health care and education, it becomes easier for that impoverished governing body to ensure basic needs of its inhabitants. .For example, a recent survey has been conducted by the UK government revealed that the immigrants who are working in health sector send 12 percent of their money to the country they belong to.As a result, it helps these countries to enrich the economy as well as assisting them to stand out on the global stage.Therefore, it is evident why that proposal is imperative to perform.\n\nAnother point I would consider that recruiting competent employees from those poverty-stricken countries is not only helpful for that poor governments but also for the well-off states.This is because when the country employs professionals who are already competent enough for that respective position, it will help them to save resources and time as they do not have to plow billions in order to prepare their natives to work in these sectors.For instance, many solvent realms like the US have their fabric industries in Asian countries, in this case, if they had to allocate money to educate and train its citizens to work in those companies, it would time-consuming let alone the cost-effectiveness, which in turn, could attribute to degrade their economic persistence,not to mention global recognition as developed nation. Not only will it be uncertain to frame a possible time limit to achieve that proficiency but it also will undermine financial growth during that training period. Thereby, it also will not be wise to undertake these type of ignorant action which is detrimental to the host countries because of its implications.\n\nTo conclude, it would be momentous to contemplate on providing employment readiness for the insolvent states.By doing so, the first world countries can pave the way for the establishment of the comprehensive economy of these countries that can barely manage the dreadful deprivation of basic needs, and rich countries can also secure its own financial stability by saving time and money."},{"question":"Woman and men are commonly seen as having different strength and weaknesses. Is it right to exclude males or females from certain professions because of their gender?\nGive reason for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","answer":"Nowadays, the life style has changed and our ideas and attitudes, about the world, has become amending. Thus, every person of both genders has different personality. Some people say that women and men should have the same opportunity to get a job depends on their qualifications and skills. On the other side, others argue that women and men don't have the same rights to get a certain profession. I think that the gender issue doesn't important this days because the societies have accepted for females and males to get any work that they want without any discrimination; however, this essay will examine point for both points.\n\nOn one hand, the conventional idea still doesn't accept to join a certain profession. This is because people were used to women working in a specific job such as upbringing the children, education, help their families in cultivation, and so on. Moreover, some people think that men can perform better and more productive in the job than women. For instance, judge, if female work as a judge, it may a hard job for her because women when she want to make the decision about the issue she depends on her emotional than her mind, so may be sometimes she makes urgent decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the rights are not excluding for males and females because, in this days, no one interested about the genders issue. In addition, the qualification, skills and individual's potential are more crucial for getting a job than the discrimination issue, and that western follow it. They give the same opportunity for men and women to get the suitable job. Everyone has the same rights and a chance to join the work that they want.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the discrimination issue shouldn't take a place in our lives because women and men should get the same rights and equally to get job in any fields that they want. Thus, when we get away about this conventional idea and change our attitude about this topic that will return to ourselves and to our societies in benefits without any discrimination between women and men."},{"question":"At the present time, the population of some countries include a relatively large number of young adults compared to the number of older people.Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages.","answer":"Some world nations today have a much higher demographic of younger generation relative to the elderly. This provides multitude of benefits like increased skilled manual labour and technically advanced individuals, which clearly outweigh the disadvantages such as lack of experience in various fields.\n\nFirstly, young people are the main source for manual work. Any developed country with strong financial and industrial backbone today has one thing in common; the number of young individuals working in all the sectors of economic growth.Youth equates to mental and physical strength which is the primary demand for strenuous labour many of the industries require. This is a valuable asset which the elderly can not provide. To illustrate, countries like Finland, where 80% of the population is well above 65 years of age, struggle to keep their industries running and have to employ foreign workers. This has had serious negative impact on the country's revenue for the past decade.\n\nYouth today is also well versed regarding technology. Since many educational, medical and industrial fields make use of advanced, automated tools and machines nowadays, the older generation is not thoroughly capable of aligning and calibrating with such advancements. This makes it difficult for them to perform effectively at their jobs. However, elders do have the benefit of vast experience from years of working and there is no substitute for that but this, in no way, is a hindrance for young generation who are quick learners and can be taught these skills by the more experienced to become efficacious at their work.\n\nTo conclude, it is evident that any country having a higher ratio of younger population as compared to older people will benefit tremendously for the aforementioned reasons.On the other hand, the skills and expertise of elderly populace can not be downplayed towards a country's development and success."},{"question":"In recent years many small local shops have closed because customers travel to large shopping centres or malls to do their shopping.\nDoes this have a positive or negative development?","answer":"Nowadays, the trend of purchasing items from big shopping malls have increased, when compared to local shops. While some say that it is a positive development, others argue that it has a detrimental effect on local economy development. In this essay, I will discuss on both sides of the argument and give my opinion.\n\nFirst, let us discuss about the positive aspects of having a large shopping centre in the vicinity. Almost every item will be available in such malls, which makes it easier for people to purchase various items without much hassle. Also, people who wish to buy branded items can do so, as companies prefer to set up their stores or showrooms in such malls. An example of this is Lulu Mall in Kerala, where a lot of people come to purchase, as all sorts of items are available there.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some negatives to having such big enterprises in a certain area. They pose a serious threat to the local economy and livelihood of people who own small shops. If these small businesses are not able to sell items, cash flow will reduce causing problems for their families.They may have to close down their shops sooner or later due to the lack of business. This in turn results in lower and middle class people turning to malls and shopping centres as there is no other alternative for them. Umpteen number of cases have been reported in news articles and television about shops going out of business due to the presence of bigger players in the market.\n\nTo sum up, the presence of malls and shopping centres are a boon to people who love to shop, but it also leads to different shops closing down due to less sales, thereby affecting the economy of that region. In my opinion such trends will only have a negative effect on local shops and businesses."},{"question":"It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\nWhat sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children?","answer":"Initial years of life for any individual are among the most essential years in a persons life, as they learn the basic difference between what is right and what is wrong. This is taught by giving them appropriate punishment, when they are unjust. In my opinion, I agree with the aforementioned statement and this essay will discuss importance of the punishment and acceptable forms of discipline techniques that should be carried out by parents and teachers.\n\nTo begin with, punishments are an imperative tool by which children are trained to distinguish between just and unjust acts. Parents motivate a child when he is doing something right by giving him praise and positive reinforcement. On the contrary, they punish him when his behaviour is unacceptable. This instils a sense of right and wrong in a learning child, thus helping him become a functioning and moral individuals of society. For instance, my nephew used to beat his classmates but after his mother had scolded him and banned his favourite video game , over time he understood his wrong doing and rectified his mistake. It can be seen that punishment is an important tool for moulding children into righteous human beings.\n\nOnly the non physical type of punishments should be carried out by teachers and parents to discipline children. Parent should use verbal retribution and take away children\u2019s luxury privileges like mobile phone, video games and laptops in case they are not acting morally. This sort of discipline will make them realise their short-comings and help them be more disciplined. Additionally, teachers can punish undisciplined students by giving them extra homework and asking to make a public apology in front of the class, thus making them aware of consequences of breaking school rules. Extreme physical form of punishment should be totally banned as it leaves a negative psychological impact on child and can cause problems like depression.\n\nTo conclude, children learn to differentiate between right and wrong with help of punishment but not all forms of discipline should be practiced as some can have harmful effect on children psyche."},{"question":"it is necessary for parents to attend parenting training course to bring children up? \ndo you agree or disagree?","answer":"Nowadays, parenting has become a challenge because of fast-moving world; therefore, it is essential parents take classes for bringing up their children. I whole hearted agree with the statement that training courses are mandatory for parents in that these courses are not only beneficial from parents\u2019 prospective but also helpful from children\u2019s prospective.\n\nA great place to begin is with the cursory examination of how parenting classes are important from parents\u2019 side. To elucidate, should parents take the classes, it will be easier for them to deal with both physical and emotional challenges faced by their children. These courses provide support and guidance to parents about the different phases a child goes through while growing up. For instance, rapidly advancing internet and social media usage make the children prone to unhealthy relationships, so with the help of these training courses parents get awareness how to handle the situation in a particular age group. Consequently, a stable relationship will be established amongst the family.\n\nNo less important than parents\u2019 prospective is children\u2019s prospective. To explain, if children realize that their parents understand their age-related needs and feelings, a sense of trust will develop in them.\nThis sense of trustworthiness helps children to share their problems with parents, and get the experienced advice from them. Moreover, a strong relationship with parents keep the children away from many unhealthy activities and psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. As a result, these children will grow up to become productive members of society.\n\nIn conclusion, parenting classes make a great contribution for children as well as parents in upbringing the children. Undoubtedly, training parenting courses play vital role in establishment of a constructive society."},{"question":"English is regarded as global language. The advantages of being global language outweigh the disadvantages.\nTo what extent you agree or disagree?","answer":"Presently, English language is now considered as globally speaking language. In my perspective, the draw backs of english as international language are eclipsed by its benefits, and support of this opinion will be presented with elaborations to justify my inclination in the succeeding paragraphs of this essay, followed by a conclusion.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of english is that foreign students of underdeveloped countries are now getting admission in universities of developed states, because these countries are mostly english speaking countries. Moreover, students migrating for the purpose of acquiring knowledge are getting education from these states, and english has helped these foreigners in communicating easily with their teachers and native residents. Take US, Canada and Australia as examples of this situation, where youngsters from African and Asian countries are immigrating for attaining tertiary education, because english is helping them making connection with other nationals. In addition to this, english is assisting scientists to share their research findings with other researchers across the border. This means that selecting english as a dialect to convey message, because it creates understandable conversation in every part of the world. This is shown in research projects executed bilaterally by Chinese and Pakistani scientist, both countries have different national languages but with this language they are working mutually.\n\nConversely, one of the major concern in making english as widely used language is that new generation will forget their native language, if they are utilizing english in their learning institutes and in work place, they will definitely not going to speak in their traditional language. For instance, parents from Pakistan and India living abroad are facing these issues; their children are not speaking their mother language. However, this issue can be ameliorated easily if elders and parents speak their native language in their home with their offspring. It has been successfully experimented by my brother and his wife living in Canada. Thus, they convert this drawback in advantage, and their son is the only bilingual child in his peer group.\n\nTo conclude, in the light of aforementioned paragraphs, I reckon that merits of english that are helping foreign students to study abroad and facilitating scientists outweigh the solvable demerit which is elimination of mother language."},{"question":"Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement.\nTo what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?","answer":"Many people assert that waste recycling from household is insufficient , and therefore, the government should set that as a compulsory task for everyone. However, I completely disagree with the previous viewpoint, and reasons will be presented in this argument.\n\nThere are two major reasons for my opinion. First of all, I believe that sense of responsibility should stem from the internal conscious of individuals. People will always find loopholes to ignore rules when they do not feel its major impact. Instead of implicating such law, the government ought to educate its people about the benefits of home-made waste recycling for the society and environment. In this sense, members of society will be more convinced to lend their hands for society such as what happened in Japan,where its government encouraged the citizens for recycling through raising their awareness of its importance.\n\nAnother reason is that this is an issue that should be tackled by the government by allocating a certain amount of its budget for recycling. If the government made this an obligatory requirement, many residents would suspect that this is just a legal method for taking their money. In addition people may detest their government if this law was imposed, leading to many undesirable consequences, such as rebelious acts, which might entail detrimental effects in the country.\n\nIn conclusion, even though recycling of home waste is crucial, I believe that it should be made by the government, through raising awarenes of population regarding it. Therefore, I absolutely disagree with aforementioned statement."},{"question":"Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and realeasing patriotric emotions in a safe way. To what extent do u agree or disagree?","answer":"It has been proposed that global sportive events, such as, football and Olympics are quite helpful in normalizing the diplomatic crisis among the nations. Not only that, these events are of vital importance in providing a way to dissipate the emotions, which individuals usually possess for the love of their countries. This essay will provide evidence in support of the afore mentioned concept and the final position will be declared in the conclusion section of this discussion.\n\nNowadays, it can be witnessed that there is an exponential rise in disputes among various nations, all over the world. There is multitude of underlying factors for this, such as, wars an backlashes over economic gains. The leaders of countries, in order to attain their goals and highlighting their rightfulness of opinions try to manipulate the emotions of the lay man: of their own as well as of the opponent country, by giving speeches with international media coverage. As a consequence of practice like this there is noticeable escalation in civic virtues among the general populations. So everyone wants to do something for for the love and welfare of his country by putting his efforts in.\n\nIn order to serve one\u2019s country and to prove his loyalty and support, people need a forum. Obviously , not everyone could go on war. So there must be some right way without any catastrophic results. Therefore, sportive festivals provides a great opportunity to the patriotic to express there devoted love for their country. Where they can openly express their selves in support and in oppose: for there own and opponent country, respectively. Thus, events such like these are great route to be emotionally honest without any harmful consequence.\n\nAfter analyzing the above, it can be concluded that sportive occasions are essential for preventing the diplomatic ties of breaking due to international tensions and providing a way out to the bottled up emotions to be released. It is for these reasons, I completely agree with the statement provided."},{"question":"Companies use major sports events to promote their products. Some say this has negative effects on sports in general.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Nowadays, many organisations spend enormous amount of money on sports events in order to boost the sales of their products. It is argued that this approach has many adverse ramifications on the integritiy of sports. I strongly disagree with the aforementioned school of thought owing to the importance of this financial assistance not only in promotion of healty recreational activities but also for the encouragement of sportsmen.\n\nUndeniably, well-known international brands have been sponsoring sport events since ages. This is to say that without this financial support, it is practicaly impossible to organize such events for masses. For example, IPL (Indian Premier League) was initiated with the money provided by Pepsico corporation in India. Now, this event has promoted Cricket on global level. Therefore, it is clear that there is no negative impact of the investments in sports by companies.\n\nIn addition to this, the world has got incredible players whose popularity took birth after their participation in such sponsored events. To explain more, corporations shoulder the burden of all the expenditures required during the upbringing of the amazing players we have. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo came in the eyes of the authorities during one of such sponsored events. Consequently, he is representing Portugal on international grounds. He has also promoted football in the streets of Portugal. Hence, it is evident by this illustration that this financial support has always been beneficial for sports.\n\nTo conclude, after analyzing the above arguments, it is my firm opinion that this approach has no negative impacts on sports. It is recommended for governments to regulate this."},{"question":"Nowadays modern gadgets are widely used by young people and the use of these products reduces their creativity.\ndo you agree or disagree??","answer":"It is argued that increased usage of technology by children has led to diminishing imaginative power. This essay disagrees that the widespread usage of modern technology has led to the gradual decrease of creativity amongst youngsters. Firstly, this essay will discuss the fact that data is available for analysis and research anytime with the help of these advanced equipments and secondly discuss how students are able to complete complex projects easily.\n\nIt can be seen that data is easily available at the fingertips with the help of these gadgets. Youngsters are able to access previous papers and articles ,and examine them for further studies. They are able to scrutinize it thereby getting relevant information, which inturn helps in expanding their thinking abilities. Around the world, in mass media and other sources, we see a lot of young minds acquiring doctoral degrees by completing and submitting research papers.\n\nStudents are able to identify and choose complex project ideas and complete them with relative ease. Easy access to data, facts and figures on various topics has brought about this amazing change. They are able to finish the projects step by step with the help of modern technology, which otherwise would not have been possible. Recently in India, a high school student designed and built the smallest satellite, which was choosen by NASA to be sent into Earth's orbit along with others. Internet was a tool that helped him with its completion.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of technology helps young minds to have a constructive mentality and also helps in fulfilling their ideas which may contribute to future generations."},{"question":"The position of women in society has changed markedly in the last twenty years. Many of the problems young people now experience, such as juvenile delinquency, arise from the fact that many married women now work and are not at home to care for their children.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","answer":"In the past two decades, the role of women in society has changed remarkably. While this being a good sign of gender equality, some believes that this has a negative effect on children.\n\nNowadays, women are career-oriented. With time their dreams have changed, so as their priorities. There is a growing urge among women to contribute to the society. Furthermore, this is not just confined within single women but also married ones. Most of the families now have working father as well as mother. Seeing this, a child can find inspiration. In addition to that, he or she will learn to understand & appreciate the effort his or her mother puts in. This also helps the young people in building respect towards women. For example, in my childhood, my mother had spent most of her time behind her studies. Although I wished she could have accompanied me more, but eventually as I grew older, I understood why she could not. She is a doctor who dedicated her life to serve humanity. Needless to say, she has a busy life. However, I was well brought up. Despite having a hectic life, my mother ensured that I grow up to be a good person.\n\nOn the other hand, a child of a working mother can turn into a negligent person. This can only happen in certain circumstances, for instance, when a mother misses her kid's sports day in school or she doesn't keep her promise of buying a particular gadget, etc. These situations can transform the teenagers into an undisciplined & irresponsible person. Moreover, the child won't even try to comprehend the efforts of his or her mother and thus end up being a spoiled individual.\n\nI personally believe a woman's road to a successful career does not pave the way for juvenile delinquency, provided that she can balance both sides of life; family and work."},{"question":"Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"The world has witnessed that capital punishment is significantly declining the crime rate in the societies. Draw backing from death penalty can make a society destabilized and the implementation of such penalties are considered inevitable to regulate violence in the society. The consequences of this shall be discussed in this essay to support my contention that why I am in agreement on the provided premise.\n\nFirstly, the societies have experienced that infringement of laws always cause the disruption and destruction of the societies. Furthermore, the non stop outbreak of these inadequate actions can lead to supplement the crime ratio and can make people more secure about their lives consequently, society would the victim of turbulence. For example, latest survey reports revealed that the Spanish\u2019s state has started to represent referendum of a separate country because the culprit of the minister death was left without getting his punishment. It was utterly unethical that\u2019s why local people of the state started disruptive movements\n\nSecondly, the implementation of such laws has many fruitful benefits for the survival of any society. Moreover, if the culprits are punished according to their offenses then the people feel satisfaction that they have taken their revenges. The fear of death penalties hinder people from committing offences before participating in any criminal activity. To illustrate this latest world peace report demonstrated that the China is the most peaceful country on the planet because in this country people do not have any fear of losing their life . Their people are punished according to their faulty actions.\n\nIn conclusion, it is obvious under the aforementioned discussion; I affirm and submit that the death penalties are mandatory to maintain peaceful circumstances in societies and to make people\u2019s lives more secure."},{"question":"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programmes (for examples working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children).\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"A lot of people think community services should be included in high school programs as mandatory. Given that high school holds an important impact on every student's life, i completely agree with the given statement.\n\nIn the current era of technology and gadgets, education has got a lot easier to access. But at the same time, it has made student life a lot more complex with various source of distractions. For example, availability of smart phones and internet connection on the go, made learning and acquiring knowledge easy through different portals along with making people social in virtual world. However this also made people isolated and unsocial in real life. The scenario is prevailing more among the students who spend idle time after school-hour and even procrastinate their given tasks. Spending hours with video gaming consoles is one of the common scenarios among students now-a-days.\n\nIn light of the above mentioned situations, inclusion of mandatory community works in school curriculum will ensure proper utilization of time of each student, in guiding and structuring their lives in a productive way. Comminity works will not only give them the sense of responsibility but also allow them to explore their true potential in providing services to the comminity. As in, working with a charitable organization (among many other community services), provides a bigger picture of life to students which they might fail to explore through their tech-oriented life. Leadership, team works, socializing, networking, exploring teaching capabilities, building rapports etc are some of the many positive outcomes of community works.\n\nIn conclusion, community services render opportunities to understand 'life' in its true meaning. Making the services mandatory for students will be nothing but remarkable."},{"question":"Traffic Jam is a problem in many towns and cities. People believe that this can be solved by making the roads wide. Do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Traffic congestion has become a major issue in many townships and metropolis. Some people argue that this problem can be best solved by making the roads wider, however, I believe that other measures like better public transport system is more effective in dealing with the traffic issues, and the reasons of my inclination shall be elucidated in the succeeding paragraphs.\n\nThe solution of a problem can be decided by understanding the causes of the problem first, so, it makes sense to describe as to what causes the traffic jams in cities. Traffic congestion is directly proportional to the number of vehicles on the road and majority of them are personal cars and bicycles which people use to commute to their desired destinations. Individuals prefer to travel in their personal vehicles because of its convenience and comfortability. Moreover, lack of comfortable public transport encourages them to choose their personal vehicles which in turn leads to more vehicles on the roads. I, for example, travel by my own car to office and most of my friends travel for 50 kms a day to reach office and all of them use their own cars.\n\nLooking at the above reasons, many people claim that wider roads would lead to less congestion as there will be more space on the roads to accommodate more vehicles. However, I feel that better and comfortable public transport system is the best solution for this. Firstly, because if there are more frequent buses and trains between routes, people will choose them over their cars. Secondly, if they are cheaper and more comfortable, it will encourage people to opt for it as it will help them save some money which they otherwise will be spending on fuel. As more and more people will choose to travel in buses and trains, it will not only help in reducing traffic but also in reduction of pollution. Most of my friends living in Delhi prefer to travel in Metro trains as they find them comfortable and faster.\n\nIn conclusion, traffic congestion is a serious issue which should be tackled carefully. As many suggest widening of roads as a way to solve this, I\u2019m strongly convinced that increasing the number and frequency of buses and trains is a more viable solution."},{"question":"Traffic jams are a problem in some towns and cities. Some people think that building wider roads will solve the issue.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Nowadays, traffic congestion is one of the major issues in some townships and metropolis. It is often argued by people that developing wide road networks is the possible remedy of traffic jams. I agree on first statement and disagree in the second premise. I will further discuss and elaborate the details and reasons in the succeeding paragraphs for better illumination of my opinion, followed by a conclusion.\n\nTraffic congestion is one of the major issues in some areas because every individual is using his own private car to reach his destination. This is because of the fact that when people utilize their own private vehicles, they always prefer to commute in it due to its comfortability and convenience. This is resulting to massive traffic jams on roads, because adequate number of cars are moving on major roads. For example, a recent survey was conducted in 2016 by scientists in the major cities of the world, and their results were clearly showing that every adult owns private car in urban area, and if there are four young adults living in one home, they probably have four cars parked in their garage. This example clearly shows that private car ownership is the major agent playing vital role in traffic blockades. Thus, some stringent steps should be taken by legislative authorities to mitigate the situation.\n\nConversely, some people contend that developing wider road networks will definitely end traffic issues, but this solution is temporary way forward as it is not long lasting solution. State authorities should provide alternate plausible solutions to counter traffic jams. To be more precise, establishing mass transit system and subways in metropolis will minimize the load of cars on roads. Consequently, every citizen prefer smooth journey, and if government is providing them safest and fastest means of transportation, general public will not consider their own vehicles for their trips. For instance, Swiss government has reduced 65% cars from their roads, and this was achieved after development of bullet train stations in city and subways. This shows that alternate methods can be adopted to counter traffic issues.\n\nIn conclusion, in light of above argument, I strongly subscribe to the former premise that traffic jams is issue in some rural and urban areas because people prefer to travel in their own cars, and I disagree with second statement wide roads will end traffic issue because it is short term solution. It is recommended that state should construct mass transit system and modern railways for citizens."},{"question":"Violence among young people has increased dramatically over the past 50 years. This rise moves in tandem with the growth in violent media. Thus the conclusion can be drawn that violent media is the main cause of violence among young people. Do you agree or disagree?","answer":"We live in an era, where crimes and intolerance is highly prevalent in teenagers. This behaviour is on the uptrend from for t from the past many years. It is strongly agreed upon that violence shown on the media is the cornerstone to this. Analyzing both the violence trend followed by youngsters shown in movies and the popularity of such films in young generation will illustrate this.\n\nTo begin with, it is widely accepted that any crime committed by an adolescent or young adult usually has a background of inspiration from Dramas or Documentaries or other stuff etc. such type of aggressive attitude shown on media serves as a nurseries for learning new tactics of breaking law and to escape it. Thus the actors in the movies act as a mentors to commit crimes for the highly prone mind of the aforementioned age group.\n\nHaving said that, there are many surveys which clearly illustrate that any mode of entertainment, if having a content of agitation, fight, killing etc will be tremendously rated by young lads. A violent movie shown in a cinema can easily have all these things. This notion can further be supported by the average number of films displayed in a theatre per day which easily outnumberoutnumbers movies based on social welfare etc.\n\nTo sum up, it is beyond any doubt that media has escalated the crime rate in a very short period of time. If unchecked, the violent media may bring further disasterous trends to the young population."},{"question":"In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think this is a positive or negative development.","answer":"In recent years, most people, especially in developed nations, opt for independent living. In my opinion, this trend has bought both positive and negative implications in equal measures.\n\nTo begin with, sole dwellers can be seen beneficial for both personal and for broader economic reasons. On individual level, person learns how to survive independently, emotionally and financially. They learn many life skills like doing household chores, paying utility bills, which help them to take critical decision themselves, consequently making them self-reliant. On the economic prospective, this trend leads to surge in demand for houses, thereby boosting the construction industry, which in turn leads to good prices for real estate market. This will result in economic growth of a country.\n\nHowever, living alone has some pitfalls which cannot be ignored. Quite evident one is lack of emotional support when required because when a person needs family support, there is on one to support him. This leads to frustrations, isolation and in worst cases, depression .Moreover, financial expenses have to be borne by person alone and hence they have to work really hard to make both ends meet, which further leads to a stressful life. From economic view, continuous demand in accommodation puts extra pressure on scarce land resources, which in turn leads to surge in property prices. This is a ripple effect which is never ending ad one problem leads to another one.\n\nTo sum up, in my opinion, increase in one person households have both positive and negative outcomes on the individual as well on the economical level, and efforts must be done to maintain a balance between demand and supply so that the advantages of living alone is not wiped out by psychological problems and exorbitant property prices"},{"question":"The threat of nuclear weapons maintains world peace. Nuclear power provides cheap and clean energy. The benefits of nuclear technology far outweigh the disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"The fear of atom bombs keeps nations away from using them and nuclear plants produces energy at low cost, without emitting high amounts of greenhouse gases. Still, nuclear technologies trigger anxiety all over the world. However, in this essay I argue that the gains of these technologies are way bigger than the drawbacks.\n\nSince the discovery of our influence on the climate through emission of gases like carbon dioxide, scientists have been searching for cleaner solutions for energy production. Nuclear plants are a good example of an environment friendly energy source. For producing megajoules of energy only little resources are needed, mostly just a few grams of uranium. In addition, compared to traditional power plants, the emission of greenhouse gases is extremely low While some people fear a disaster if one of these nuclear plants explode, this risk is way lower than the risk on the hazards that may result from global warming. Consequently, because climate change is irreversible, nuclear power is a good solution until a better technology is invented.\n\nAnother example of a nuclear technology is used in warfare. Many of the greatest powers on this earth have several atom bombs or H-bombs. While this may not seem like a good development, these weapons have not been used since the second World War. Scientists argue that this is due to the theory of mutual destruction. This means that when a nation launches a nuclear missile, this country will face total destruction by nuclear weapons from other nations. Therefore, launching nuclear weapons practically implies suicide. Hence, owning nuclear weapons is the best defense against begin struck by them. As a result, this equilibrium causes world peace, instead of threatening it.\n\nAll in all, I agree with the fact that nuclear technology can be extremely hazardous. However, the advantages of nuclear energy far outweigh the risks that global warming induce. Also, while nuclear weapons are the most dangerous means in warfare, they lead to a good balance between great powers, which makes sure our world peace stays intact."},{"question":"More and more robots carry the task today at home and at work.  Do think is it positive or negative development?","answer":"Advancements in technology have brought new innovations like robots to our daily routines. Robots are being used on large scale to do the different household tasks and even at workplaces.This situation has a multitude of positive ramifications like accuracy in delicate works and less workforce required to do the heavy jobs.However, this situation has the drawback of affecting the jobs of humans. This essay will discuss both the perspectives, followed by a cogent conclusion.\n\nRobots usually operate through a computer system which guides them to accomplish their target. As a result, the robots are capable of doing the sensitive tasks with more precision as compared to the humans.As computer gives a command for each target and robots do only commanded work which reduces the risks of human error. In addition to this, robots are not affected by factors like hot and cold weather which also gives them a better chance to do sensitive jobs precisely. For example. recently robots have performed the heart surgeries in Japan and the outcomes of these have been better than the surgeries done by humans, as reported by Japenese medical association. Secondly, robots are more powerful than humans. they can do the heavy work quickly and without being tired. One robot is usually capable of the doing the work of 4-5 people. Thus, these advantages show that how robots can bring a positive change in our lives.\n\nOn the contrary, as less number of robots are required to do the task of more humans, this deprives the people of their jobs.Consequently, the crime ratio goes higher when people are cannot find the job and are unable to look after themselves and their families. This situation can prove fatal for the human society.\n\nTo conclude. in the light of aforementioned arguments, I strongly believe that positive aspects of accuracy and less number required to do a job by robots is more beneficial and a positive development. Thus, it is hoped that usage of robots is encouraged in the future."},{"question":"These days people pay more attention to artists (writers, painters, and so on) and give less importance to science and technology?\nTo what extent you agree or disagree?","answer":"People have different views about their interests on science and technology or creative fields. Although nowadays artists are being more popular than past, I disagree that science and technology is treated less vital in a society.\n\nTo begin with, there are several reasons to explain the growing popularity of artists in recent times unlike the past. Artists such as painters, writers, musicians, filmmakers are acknowledged and appreciated for their respective works by a wider range of audience than they used to get 10 years back . One of the main reasons for this recognition is the fact that connectivity amongst people across the globe increased drastically due to technological advancements. For example, a film made in India is hugely appreciated and prized as the best movie of the year by the Oscars which is held in America. Also an European author, J.K.Rowling has immense popularity for her bestselling book called \u201cHarry Potter \u201c in many countries. These examples prove that artists are admired by huge number of people due to developments made in the field of science and technology. If science and technology had not shown progress, artists would not have an opportunity to exhibit their work across nations and get people\u2019s attention.\n\nNevertheless, the growing attention of creative fields does not deteriorate the importance of science and technology. People are still keen on experimenting with science and technology to provide more advance equipments and facilities for society. For instance, lasted gadgets such as mobiles or laptops have been launched every successive year. Scientists never avert themselves to invent new things. Thus, progress in science and technology reflects the progress of any country and its importance is never reduced amongst people.\n\nIn conclusion, I am unconvinced that people undervalue science and technology,just because artists are gaining more attention. I strongly believe that both are equally imperative and interconnected with each other for a country\u2019s progress."},{"question":"Governments should be responsible for funding and be controlling scientific research rather than private organizations.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"In this era of modern technology, advancement in the field of scientific research is imperative for the progress of every country.It is argued by many that scientific experimentation should be conducted and controlled by the government.While others believe that this authority should be given to private companies.This essay strongly agrees with this assertion that government should take the charge of such scientific investigations, and will justify my stance in succeeding paragraphs of the essay before reaching to a conclusion.\n\nThere are many reasons that these experiments should be regulated by public sector one of these that research in the field of national defense, nuclear technology, and military intelligence is very crucial as these are in the national interest and demands a high-level of secrecy.These cannot be left on the shoulders of private companies.In this era of money worship, it is highly a possibility that the desire of money making would drive these private organizations to leak such confidential information to the arrival country and could be misused against that country.Thus, the government should take the lead of scientific research.\n\nA further point to be made is that it has been observed that when the funding for the research comes from the same organization that is going to gain from the favorable outcome, then there is a strong potential for biased results.Taking an example of pharmaceutical companies, these companies invest a huge amount of money on these investigations and obviously they expect positive results in any case whether the drug is dangerous for patients and in such circumstances a huge pressure comes on the shoulder of scientists and it would be difficult for them to be impartial.\n\nTo recapitulate, on the basis of above grounds I strongly agree with this notion that scientific investigations should be carried out by the public sector as the government can only provide unbiased results and also can keep results secret for their country."},{"question":"Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"It is irrefutable that people purchase a lot of unnecessary items, because they get influenced from the advertisements. Although, I agree with the notion, it is not the only factor that increases sales. I shall put forth arguments to justify my inclination, in the succeeding paragraphs, before reaching a cogent conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, advertisements greatly affect the mindsets of individuals about buying desired things. They not only trust endorsements blindly, but also waste their hard-earned money to get products without requirement. It occurs due to the eye-catching display effects and impractical results shown. For instance, my aunt holds the belief that, whatever is represented in the advertisements is true and always end up purchasing products without their real need. Thus, it is evident that advertisements are one of the significant reasons of burgeoning sales.\n\nHowever, there exists certain other factors which are responsible for hike in sales. First of all, the newer generation holds a superiority complex, which compels them to buy unnecessary things. As a result, they keeps on converting their desires into requirements, inadvertently. For example\u200b, an increase of 15% in sales of cars has been observed than previous decade, as all members of the families feel the need of their own vehicles. Secondly, the isolated nature of modern people coerces them to possess as many things as possible, in order to avoid depending upon others. Therefore, it is safe to say that individual's self-gratification and non reliance on others, influences the sales in a more positive manner.\n\nTo conclude, as discussed in the aforementioned paragraphs, it is crystal clear that advertisements do affect the sales, but the major benefit is gained from the people's obsession of self-satisfaction and isolation."},{"question":"More and more robots are used now a days in home and in workplace. What do you think it is positive or negative development?","answer":"It is undeniable that robotic machines have greatly assisted the individuals in one way or the other. Although, I believe that it brings positive outcomes, the negative implications are far-reaching. In this essay, the favourable results of using robots will be discussed alongwith the over reliance of people on them, before reaching a reasoned conclusion.\n\nIntelligent machines have made the lives of people easier. These devices perform the basic household chores like moping, in lesser time and with more accuracy. As a result, people use their precious time to do more fruitful tasks that would develop a sense of satisfaction in them. In the same vein, robots carry out various operations at offices. They do jobs under hazardous environment and control the machines as well. For instance, a robot can easily perform job with concentration under severe conditions of noise and vibrations, which would be difficult for a normal individual to carry out. Thus, it is evident that day to day tasks of humans are easily carried out by intelligent machines.\n\nHowever, the unfavourable ramifications of robots cannot be overlooked. The main impact of such devices on people, is the over reliance. Individuals keep on depending on robotic devices, which in turn, makes them lazy. As a result, they catch certain health ailments. For example, a recent survey reported that an increase in obesity of younger generation is observed, because of reduced physical work. Additionally, intelligent machines are meant to follow the instructions given to them and the inappropriate instructions can result into disastrous situations. It is so because robots do not use their own intelligence and depends upon the guidelines feeded in their programs. Therefore, the over dependence and improper commands given to such machines can make the circumstances worse.\n\nTo conclude, as the aforementioned arguments have justified my inclination towards negative development, the over usage of robots at both homes and workplaces would certainly lead to a perilous state for the society and is therefore, not advisable."},{"question":"Government should spend money on railways rather than roads.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","answer":"Which mode of transportation deserves more money from the government is an ongoing debate. Some people advocated that the governing body ought to allocate more fund on railways instead of the roads.I strongly agree with this view because of its impact on the economic development. This essay will clarify the reason which will underpin my opinion.\n\nTechnically, government investment on roads indirectly subsidy to traffic congestion. This is because, if the authority constructs more roads rather than railways, they will encourage its inhabitants to use more private cars which are the major contributor to gridlock. To illustrate this point, take Bangladesh as an example, where private car sells has been increased by 15 percent since 2016, owing to the building of an extensive road network. Afterwards, the citizens have to waste more than 3 to 4 hours while commuting because of high-intensity traffic jams.\n\nConversely, capital expenditure on the railway development aid to secure a comprehensive economy. This is because by ensuring faster and safer locomotor services, not only will the authority attract more tourist but also many merchandisers to trade with the country. For example, since China introduced the high-speed electric trains, its export business, and tourist industries have highly incorporated into the economy. Thus it is evident why the states should devise some strategy to spend money on the development of an integrated subway system.\n\nTo conclude, having discussed the implications of spending a substantial amount of money on roads, I am of the opinion that the budgeting more money on railways would be much more fruitful as it will enhance the financial development of a country as it enriches tourist and trade companies."},{"question":"Some people warn that the era of the silver screen is coming to an end and that people will eventually lose interest in going to the cinema.\nDo you agree or disagree with this view?\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your experience.","answer":"Many citizens notify that the generation of movie theater falls and the attention to cinema gradually reduces in the community. People are going to the cinema for entertaining and social gathering. I believe the popularity of theater never diminishes.\n\nFirstly, people mainly visiting cinema for leisure activity. There is nothing other pleasure than watching a favorite movie in a theater complex. The facilities in the cinema intensify the entertainment at its best. Currently, the infrastructure of the cinema is comparatively higher than the past. For instance, the survey conducted by one of the famous film magazines in Kerala, named Nana, shows many families prefer to watch in the theater than last year because of the newly refurbished theaters. \n\nSecondly, watching movies in theater provide a quality time with friends and family. People enjoy movies more when they are watching films in a group. For example, the public becomes cheerful and claps when their superstar appearing on a screen. In contrast watching movies in the home never give us that experiences. Therefore people always try to watch movies in the theater for social influences.\n\nNevertheless, watching movies in a theater is expensive than the past. DVDs are cheap and the internet provides free movies. However, the majority of people select cinema for watching film due to the experiences that they are providing.\n\nTo conclude, due to the invention of advanced technology, the cinema becomes more recreational than the past. In my opinion, I agreed that the publicity is spontaneously growing because of the experiences and quality time that cinemas are providing to the communities."},{"question":"Some people claim that not enough of the waste from homes is recycled. They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement.\nTo what extent do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?","answer":"In contemporary era, recycling is a pivotal part of society. Some folks blame that majority of domestic waste is not utilized. They believe that for enhancement of recycling government should take strong actions in the shape of laws and rules. I strongly agree that policies are vital for more reuse of human waste. And my notions and arguments shall be elaborated in succeeding paragraphs, followed by a conclusion.\n\nFor the regulation for every system, legal codes have importance. Recycling is the best remedy for cleaning the waste from society. But unfortunately, merely few people are participating in this act while others are denying from it. In Pakistan, for instance, in last year, authorities design a rule regarding recycling and also organizing variety of competitions through which youngsters bring innovative notions of converting rough material into beneficial object like from disposal cups designing spectacular artifacts.\n\nFurthermore, without laws, society will be lawlessness. So for thrive a stunning environment rules are solely solution. In university, for example, students are following all procedure and policies for maintaining discipline. In the same case, leaders must declare strict rules for converting waste into reusable material. If today, they are not taking any serious actions then in future they will see bundle of wastes in every corner. Because without laws, people of community will not do any activity regarding recycling. That is why, policies are pivotal for this act.\n\nIn conclusion, illuminate of above paragraphs, the government is only centre stage actor for conversion of rough material into useful form."},{"question":"More and more robots are used nowadays in home and in workplace. What do you think it is positive or negative development?","answer":"In recent years, most of the work at home and at workplace are done by robots. In fact, robots have become an essential part of our life. I am of the view that the incorporation of robots in our life is a positive development, and this argument will be further elaborated in the forthcoming paragraph.\n\nRobots enable humans to live a comfortable and luxurious life, because most of the domestic work , including washing, cleaning and dusting are accomplished by robots. This in turn, adds comfort and luxury in our life. Another significant impact of robots in our life is in financial matters, as robots perform a significant amount of work at home , which helps to save money; which would otherwise be spending on hiring servants. Hence, it is clear that robots are providing ease at home.\n\nRegarding workplace, robots carry out a huge portion of our work at offices, factories, and industries, since they ensure safety and perfection. Owing to the fact that robots have pre installed software and hardware, which are programmed to perform specific tasks ,therefore there are minimal chances of human error. In terms of safety, robots are operating high voltage machines and working in nuclear reactors , consequently they minimize the human contact with such life threatening machines. O the basis of these arguments ,it has become obvious that robot are playing extremely pivotal role in our professional life.\n\nTo conclude , after analyzing the significant impact of robots in our domestic and professional life , there is no doubt that the involvement of robots in our daily life is a healthy progress. \u2014 with Rafael Salguero and Favian Alvis Cato Conroy."},{"question":"In recent years, many small local shops have closed because customers travel to large shopping centres or malls to do shopping.\nIs this a positive or a negative development?","answer":"In the modern times, there is a significant rise in numbers of people intend to do shopping from large shopping centres.Although, it does have certain benefits.I am of the opinion that, it would cause dire consequences for local shopkeepers.\n\nThere are certain advantages associated with the opening up of shopping malls.First of all, they provide a variety of products under a single roof, which consequently reduces humans' effort and time.Secondly, they do provide employment to a large number of local residents.For instance, if I may present an example, the place where I live has a large mall offering employment to three hundred local graduates.\n\nHowever, shopping malls also lead to cause dire consequences for small shopkeepers.As due to rising trend of shopping from stupendous malls, local businessmen nowadays are not in a position to even earn sufficient money for their survival.Either these people are shifting towards private jobs or indulging themselves in criminal activities.For example, a recent news published in local newspaper depicts that some shopkeepers have become convicted criminals and committing heinous actions for their survival.Opening up of malls is a curse for shopkeepers.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to stress that although there are inevitable advantages associated with large shopping centres.but for middle-class shopkeepers, it brings a lot of difficulties with them.In fact, earning bread and butter have become a dream for a common seller."},{"question":"Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","answer":"Local dialects nowadays are dying out due to certain reasons.An insignificant number of people believe that it will make the people lives easier.I completely agree with this proposition because of some reasons.\n\nThere are certain advantages associated with the extinction of languages. First of all, it will certainly give chance to the people to manifest their skills on an international platform, that others which are bound with their traditional language cannot do, for instance, presently skilled workers in countries like India could not find jobs in Europeans countries as these people can only communicate in their local language.Secondly, students, those had studied their subjects in local languages find more difficult to clear an interview with a non-native language. If I may present an example, a recent study depicts that thirty percent of students who have cleared their written examination for Government jobs several times find themselves incapable of clearing an interview as a result of the language problem.Lastly, using more languages adversely affecting people in their coordination.\n\nHowever, opponents of aforementioned thought would argue that languages are related to their ethnic origins, so these should not become extinct, but youth generation finds no practical use of learning and speaking these local languages.As proficiency in regional languages has not required in any recruitment process.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to stress that, using more languages will not be advantageous for personal as well as communal growth.In fact, contemporary governments should support the idea of using fewer languages."},{"question":"ACCORDING TO THOSE IN THE TRAVEL BUSINESS , the nature of the average HOLIDAY IS CHANGING RATHER THAN SEEKING A RELAXING BREAK IN A FAR AWAY PLACE , people now want excitement on their holiday and are keen to participate in unusuall and challenging activities . \nDO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE ?","answer":"Holidays seem to be relaxing pause between busy routines. It has been observed by the travel advisors that , the trend of spending vacations have changed from the past as nowadays , people prefer to spend their holidays doing adventurous activities instead , of looking for comfort or calm . I completely agree with this assertion attributed to the growing use of internet. In addition to that, People likes to play unusuall sports and desire to get rid of the relaxing routine at home on holidays .\n\nIn contemporary world , everything a person do is on social media and shares their personal stories with people to start new trends , by influencing people with their amazing videos . To elaborate , in 2017 , a video became immensely famous on instagram in which , a men was seen diving in sea from 15m height in Malaysia to experience thrill and excitement , after watching this video people got influenced and performed same challenging task on holidays , to start a trend on instagram by uploading videos and tagging friends on instagram , which became very popular . Thus , it is apparent from this example that , changing in the nature of holidays is because of the escalating use of technologies in 21st century.\n\nThere is another aspect to this argument , some people say that vacations are the time to relax and to unwind from all the daily activities . Therefore , they should be spent in traditional ways like sleeping r by sitting at the beach enjoying calmness . However, in my opinion to release stress. Similarly , to change from the same monotonous routine of life , in modern times , people prefer to go on ventures to experience a peak of excitement and referesh their mind and body with the unusuall darings . For instance , in a latest survey in 2017 , it was reported by the travel business workers that people are interested more in visiting places like Chile in USA to experience hiking on holidays . This proves that , holidays become worth memorable , when they are spent performing adventurous activities.\n\nTo sum up , I completely agree with the notion that people are spending vacations to seek adventure and to show the world with their exciting experiences , which I firmly support as great ways of refereshing . Given this situation , it seems that, travelling agencies should organise activities to make holiday trips memorable."},{"question":"Some people prefer to live in a house, while others feel that there are more advantages to living in an apartment. Are there more advantages than disadvantages of living in a house compared with living in an apartment?\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","answer":"Whenever a person is searching for a place to live, he is often faced with the choice of living in a house or an apartment. Both of these accommodations have its own merits and demerits, but my opinion is that living in a house have more advantages than disadvantages.\n\nAmong few disadvantages, we can first discuss the financial aspect. Living in a house, by purchasing or renting, is always much more expensive than an apartment. For example, as per a study conducted by Times of India, the new generation is preferring apartments over houses mainly due to cost involved. Also there is a growing trend of nuclear families, who prefer smaller apartments over large houses.\n\nHowever, advantages of a house outweigh the disadvantages. If a person is faced with dilemma of purchasing house or apartment, he should always choose house due to ownership of land. To further elaborate, a person gets the advantage of own land with a house, which can be used for car parking or small part of it can be converted into a private garden. Another clear advantage is the availability of more space in a house. In India, people still prefer to live with parents and hence, houses are given priority over a flat. Moreover, a person can organise personal events at his house itself. For example, I recently went to a birthday party which was organised at my cousins house and they were able to avoid extra cost of arranging a hotel because of their own house.\n\nIn conclusion, while several people may prioritise an apartment, I believe that living in a house is more advantageous due to benefits of land ownership and availability of more space."},{"question":"Many people believe that parents are not so close to their children as they used to be. suggest some reasons?","answer":"It is true that people nowadays have become more busy than ever. Many people argue that parents are now unable to keep company with their offspring . It is believed that the reasons behind this fact are the involvement of both parents in earning money as well as the unhealthy daily routine of adolescents.\n\nFirstly , it is evident that biological parents across the world strive to become economically stable. A study in the U.S ,for instance ,illustrated that 70% of both parents work extra hours to raise reasonable amount of money. This pursuit of economical stability actually deprives them to spend time with their children. Therefore, the healthy relationship that could be seen among children and their parents deteriorates. \n\nIn addition to this, children the world over are compelled to follow an awful routine . For instance, students stay in their education centres for approximately 6 hours. After finishing their homework ,they begin to seek stimulation from television or the internet. Because of the absence of their role models, they often hang out with their friends. This pattern of daily routine makes them recalcitrant and somewhat impersonal in nature. These factors are deemed to have negative impact on their relationship with their guardians. \n\nTo conclude, struggle of parents to gain economical independency along with poor routine of adolescents are the two major reasons of decreased closeness among parents and their kids. Hopefully the parents get to know the importance of a nuclear family."},{"question":"The quality of health care a person receives should not depend on the size of their bank balance. The government is responsible for providing a high level of heath care for all its citizens. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"A great Health care system should be considered on a priority basis on any government\u2019s national reform list, as health is the true wealth of a nation. Some people are of the opinion that health concerns of an individual should not commensurate directly with the wealth. Whereas, The others believe government should provide free, prime health facilities to all its citizens. I totally agree that the government should be at the helm of setting up sound health care schemes.\n\nFirstly, I believe that at the onset of economic and fiscal development the physical and mental health of the plebeians should be of a major concern. For instance, in the USA all the senior citizens are entitled to free medical check-ups and free treatment, hospitalisation and medicines for all its citizens. Which has led to people feeling less overburdened and financially taxed because of arising health issues.\n\nSecondly, I also strongly believe that the government should aim for healthy and happy individuals as along with development and prosperity it is high time it pays attention to improvising the quality of life. In economies like India or Pakistan where medical expenses are too exorbitant, or partially privatised then the sound or private healthcare facilities cannot be availed of by even the middle-class or the poor.\n\nSo, I sensibly and ostensibly conclude that a healthy nation can only work towards growth, development and advancement of a nation, because then the people also start believing as the government proves to genuinely nurture and cares for their patrons."},{"question":"Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","answer":"Language plays the most important role for any communication between individuals. It has been said that each year certain languages extinct. Some people believe that this concern is not important as fewer languages will make life easy. This essay will discuss about this issue before reaching a rational conclusion.\n\nAs a result of globalization, due to its indirect effect several languages die out every year. First of all, as the usage of internationally spoken language such as English is increasing day by day, due to its adverse impact and encouragement many locally spoken languages are dying out, for example, many parents are using English language in front of their child, so that he\/she can develop it rapidly, despite of their native language. Apart from this, influence over learning English is increasing because of its utilization in every field of work. So, all these factors lead to deceleration in the use of several languages and eventually it dies.\n.\nSome individuals support the above given fact and think that it makes life very easy. Firstly, because of utilization and development of some foreign languages in social and work life, it reduces the gap between people in the whole world. They all unite and contribute to development of whole world not only to their region or nation. Finally, as a future result career opportunity for all individuals increases and it will open doors to every part of the world.\n.\nIn a nutshell, I am of opinion that less international languages will increase efficiency of the people of whole world and every nation will get equal chance to participate in that development."},{"question":"The Internet will never replace traditional course books in schools. How far do you agree with this prediction???","answer":"Huge range of the study resources are available nowadays and their right selection is crucial in the effective learning of students. While I agree that the text books can never be substituted by the modern technology, as course books are authentic (tell me comma will come or full stop) However, I also believe that the Internet has introduced entirely different learning techniques for students, which has made them independent and self -sufficient more than ever before.\n\nThe course books are developed by the pedagogical experts and are designed in a way to be incorporated into the school syllabus. This makes the text books an integral part of the school curriculum, which enables them to access the performance of students in the form of the academic achievements and continuous assessments, leading to the progression of students towards further and higher education. Moreover, unlike the modern technology, the school books are an authentic source of information that can be relied on with the closed eyes. For instance, if hundreds of websites are available to a student for a single topic , he will never be able to differentiate which one of them is genuine.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, the Internet has revolutionized the traditional teacher-led system in an entirely modern way. Leaving guided learning process behind , the Internet has not only helped students in the distance learning , but also helped them in data gathering via the self \u2013study modules . To illustrate, browsing or surfing sites online like google , you tube which has enabled the young learners to explore any topic just by clicking a button while sitting at home. In addition, in terms of the supplementing knowledge and making the young learners more autonomous, the role of the internet is unrivalled. Therefore, if internet was not there, neither the independant research methodologies nor the study skills would have been reinvigorated.\n\nTo conclude, although the internet has provided a new direction to the rote learning process and given an autonomy to pupils, I believe that the text books are still a fundamental part of the school studies and the reliable sources of information . Because of the quality and depth of material , an absolute trust on the Internet will take time to develop."},{"question":"In many countries plastic shopping bags are the main source of rubbish, causing pollustion on land and in water, so people think they should be banned.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree.","answer":"Pollution by plastics continue to be a burning issue in today's world, as they pose a great threat to the environment. With the global rise in consumerism culture, plastic shopping bags are considered to be the major contributor in this form of pollution. However, to tackle this issue a range of options are being considered in many countries, including banning of these bags.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that plastics are having a devastating impact on the environment. The main problem with plastics is that it is not degraded by natural process. As a result, they tend to exist in soil for millions of years, which in turn interfere with the quality of soil such a manner that it gradually looses its fertility. Loss of fertility may negatively affect the agriculture, resulting in diminished productivity and thus may lead to food scarcity in extreme Conditions. Another problem with plastics is that being insoluble in water it is carried away by drainage systems into river and ultimately into oceans where it tend to damage the local ecosystem. Furthermore, recent studies on microplastics reveal that minute particles of plastic are virtually present in all types of drinking water, including bottled water that was considered safer than tape water in the past. Thus, the threats caused by plastics on our planet seems quite horrifying.\n\nTo deal with the issue of plastic pollution, it seems quite reasonable for governments to impose a ban on the use of plastic bags, as they are regarded to be the main culprit behind this. It is true that such a ban can to some extent reduce the usage of these bag, thus minimizing plastic pollution. However, in order to fully address this problem, awareness programmes focusing on the adverse effects that plastics are having on our environment should be promoted by the governments in collaboration with mass media and social media. Such awareness programmes may discourage people to use of plastic bags and encourage them to recycle plastic products. In addition to this, alternatives to plastics that are biodegradable should be made readily available, so that people can use these products for their daily shopping.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that in addition to banning, governments should take initiatives to raise public awareness regarding plastic pollution and promote alternatives to plastics, thus ensuring a better future to all life forms in the Earth."},{"question":"Some people think that univeristies should provide graduates with the knowledge and skilss needed in the workpalce . Other think that the true function of a univeristy should be to give access to knowledge for its own safe , regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer.\nWhat, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university?","answer":"A tertiary institute plays a vital role in building career of a student. A highly controversial issue today relates to academic pattern of universities. There are those who assume that pupil should be taught only those subjects which are beneficial for their future employment. However,others believe that syllabus of students should comprise of different subjects and expertise whether affiliated or non affiliated with future jobs. I firmly agree with the statement described above because univeristies should organise their courses and programs in order to provide future employees with all the skill sharpening professional training for their specific occupation.\n\nPrimarily, there are people who argue that benefits of learning only specific subjects related to the workplace considerably outweighs its disadvantages .The main reason for believing this is that now adays all contemporary occupations are task specific which makes it a necessity for workers to be able to comply with every job requirement . Once they graduate they are expected to take over all the responsibilities their job needs them to do .One good illustration of this is , when i did my housjob from civil hospital, I did a part time job for a hospital as a medical officer . I was overwhelmed with all the expectations my employer had in everyday practice, whereas there was no need at all of all the theory i had studied in my undergraduate syllabus .\n\nIn addition to this argument , there are also important areas where universities focus to provide the basic knowledge of the entire subject and let the students choose the job of their interest . for instance , An engineering university teaches it students different courses like telecommunications , civil and aeronautical engineering . It depends on the students that which career they want to persue . This is also in favour of the employers.\n\nIn conclusion , i believe that advantages of giving knowledge about subjects which are helpful for students in their employment are more because it polishes the skilss of individuals in their respective fields."},{"question":"Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which one would you prefer?","answer":"Well, Our preference for working enviorment vary from a person to person. Psychology teaches us that we all have indvidual differneces and no humans are alike. So automatically our prefernces and desires will also have differences. If I analyse myself, I guess I would like to work in large company. I would highlight the following reasons below in the essay.\n\nFirst of all, the major factor which contributes in selecting our working enviorment is our personality traits. For example, extroverts would like to interact with people so eventually they would like to work in large company because they would get an opportunity to interact with more people and expand their social circle, whereas introverts are typically shy, so their priority would be to work alone.\n\nApart from this large company have an enormous amount of advantages over small companies. Firstly, Large companies are well known and recognised, so the person working in the large company can associate himself with the name of company he is working in and feel a sense of pride in it. Secondly, large companies can pay you more than small companies. And in this contemporary era, There are too many expenses that its nearly impossible to live a contended life without a good pay. Moreover, in large companies you're likely to be given tasks which require group work. This gives the indvidual an opportunity to develp good social relations with his\/her co-workers. Because large companies earn more, so they will offer you more fringe benefits and perks. Fringe benefits like, car from the company, free restauraunt coupans, trips and e.t.c. Hence, a person who will work in a large company with all these benefits would be more motivated to work hard than a person who works in small copmany.\n\nComing towards me, I am a typical extrovert and I make rational decisions on logical reasoning. According to me benefits of large company totally outweigh benefits offered by small company. Considering all of this my first priority would be to work in a large company."},{"question":"Bringing in foreign workers to fill positions that domestic workers are unwilling to do can cause problems in the local community and should, therefore, be stopped. To what extent you agree or disagree?","answer":"It has been argued workers from other countries should not be employed on the jobs that local people do not want to do because it can create problems in that particular region. I strongly disagree with this assertion owing to the fact that those positions will be left vacant which can create more problems.\n\nThe main reason why I disagree with those who believe foreign workers should not be employed on positions which local people are unwilling to perform is that these tasks will be left undone and nobody will do it which will create more problems. For instance, countries in the Middle East hire doctors from different parts of the world because they do not produce any in their own country. If they halt foreign doctors from coming who would run the major health sector and due to this any nation would collapse. The results of this approach would be deleterious on society, therefore, I believe it is not recommended to stop foreign workers.\n\nHowever, I would say that instead of trying to stop in order to overcome social issues government should opt for several other measures in order to diminish the problems created by them. For example, employees who come from different parts of the world does not know the rules and regulations of the host country. This is why they must be guided thoroughly so they would be able to adjust and the government should sign a policy that if any problem occurs they will be asked to leave. Canada is a prime example which is a hub of people from different nations working over there yet they are very successful because they maintain a decorum due to their strict rules. This approach is helpful in terms of work not being affected because of lack of staff and that proper rules are being followed.\n\nIn conclusion, I completely disagree with the idea that workers from other countries should not be employed because it will create problems of sectors being vacant and no one to do that work. Given this situation, it seems that foreign employees should be guided in a proper manner to avoid any problem."},{"question":"In recent years , many small local shops have closed because customers travel to large shopping centers or malls to do their shopping.\nIs this a positive or negative development ?","answer":"Nowadays, people prefer to do shopping from large shopping centers and malls, which leads to the shutdown of many regional stores. I believe that the tendency to purchase from enormous commercial centers increase because which are convenient and economical to the public than local shops.\n\nTo begin with, bigger shopping malls help people to purchase many products from one place. Modern commercial complex consist multibrand stores and which provide opportunity for consumers to choose wide range of products without hectic journey, and also it save our precious time. In addition,due to many shops, merchandiser can purchase bulk amount of product from factory with an enormous discount, so that they can provide comparitively large discount to customers than the single shop. Lulu mall in India is a prime example, where we can buy wide range of brands in a better reduction rate than other single outlet in India.\n\nOn the other hand, it is argued by some that people's preferance to purchase from larger shopping centers negatively affect the regional people as it terminate their employment. These small local shops are the primary income for some individuals. As a result of closing the current shop block their income and which leads to poverty. For example, a survey conducted by time magazine shows that many local shops were shutdown due to the lack of customer, and which is one of the reasons to increase the poverty in provinces.\n\nTo conclude, large shopping centers provide various merchandise with inexpensive rate, also which help to give employment possibility to many local people. Therefore, in my opinion, the lifestyle of people who travel to shopping malls and centers is a positive development in the community because which has many benefits."},{"question":"Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve the growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree??","answer":"Nowadays, there is an ever-increasing trend of automobiles which has caused traffic congestion and air pollution. Some are of the view that, the most effective solution to deal with these problems is by raising the petrol price. However, in my opinion, I completely disagree with this notion as it will not work and several other alternatives can be possible to cope up with the issues of traffic congestion and pollution which are discussed in this essay.\n\nRaised taxes on fuel cannot help in mitigating pollution and traffic woes because petrol is not the only source of energy on which the majority of industries and automobile users are relying. This in turn means that, they can switch to other energy resources such as natural gas in order to fulfil their requirements as and when required. Moreover, by the raised prices of fuel, there will be a wide ranging and damaging implications to the most crucial and vulnerable component of society, the common man. Remarkable increase in the petrol rates not only will make it impossible to buy fuel but also will cause a tremendous rise in almost every product of daily use by an average man. Hence, if the fuel prices are raised , they will significantly affect only the average individuals not the industrialists and car owners who have no affordability issues.\n\nNevertheless, other alternatives are also there to curb the issues of traffic and air pollution. Japan, for instance, who has provided its citizens with cheap and an environment friendly public transport, where people prefer tandem walking and buses for transport rather than travelling in their personal cars. As a result, 50% of their fuel expenses have been reduced and so is the pollution problem . In addition, certain other initiatives, such as, take an example of New Zeland , where certain laws have been enacted by the government in terms of providing free chargeable spots for electrical vehicles ,hence promoting its use to a greater extent. Thus, traffic and pollution problems can be dealt with the strict implementation of these laws which have mutualistic benefits for both individuals and society.\n\nTo sum up, having discussed the reasons above, it can be concluded that if the petrol price is raised , neither the businessmen nor the automobile users are significantly affected, but the common man in terms of affordability. So, I am of the view that, the problems of traffic congestion and pollution can best be solved by the strict implementation of the eco-friendly legislatures and by the introduction of better transport infrastructure that will yield far superior fruitful results than merely raised petrol prices."},{"question":"In some countries, many more people are choosing to live alone nowadays than in the past. Do you think it is a positive or negative development??","answer":"Living alone has become far more normal than it was in the past in some countries. In my opinion, while this trend of living alone has some positive aspects, it also has some negative consequences in equal measure as discussed in this essay.\n\nOn the one hand , living alone is beneficial in number of ways. From personal point of view, individuals who live alone become more independent and self -reliant than those who live with their family members. This means that all of the tasks for instance, cleaning, washing, groceries and home budget are managed by individuals on their own.All of these are the valuable life skills to achieve , which can be attained only through living alone. If personal hygiene is taken into consideration, living alone will be advantageous for the persons because it can save them from contagious diseases. To illustrate, diseases like pulmonary TB, AIDS, malaria, cholera and hepatitis; all of which are spread by coming in contact with the affected individuals. The person who lives alone can thus eliminate such viral and bacterial diseases as well as be more self sufficient.\n\nOn the contrary, the trend of one person household has several drawbacks. Firstly, instead of producing feelings of independence, a sense of isolation, depression and frustration have been generated among people residing alone. They miss out on the emotional support and friendly conversations which they can share while living together with their family members, relatives or flatmates. Secondly, this trend of living alone has raised the property prices to a peak level leading to a massive burden on economy. Hence, it can be said that both a sense of being alone and raised property prices may result if this trend of living alone will keep on rising.\n\nTo conclude, although living alone provides individuals with confidence of managing household chores all by themselves, it is also detrimental at the same time in terms of isolation and causing substantial burden on the property business that will affect the economy adversely."},{"question":"The money spent on space programmes would be better spent on vital public services such as schools and hospitals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Money expenditure on space programmes has recently become a topical issue. It is argued that this money should be channelised towards more beneficial community sectors, such as health and education. In my opinion, I completely agree with this proposition because it has more positive and practical implications.\n\nThe main reason why I argue that money spent on space industry should be directed to health and education is that it will have a direct impact on general public. Since people pay taxes to the government in order to get good health and educational facilities, so wasting these tax revenues on impractical activities such as spaceship would be injustice to people. For example, India and North Korea are two countries which are spending a substantial sum of money on nuclear and space programmes, while 50% of their population is impoverished and has been living below red line. People of such countries do not have access to basic health and education facilities. It is therefore potentially unwise to spend a huge amount of funds on such useless activities as spaceship.\n\nAlthough some people consider that more budget for aeronautical affairs could result in excellence in this field, which may improve country\u2019s image all over the world. This is however, not a practical idea. For instance, a billion-dollar space project of USA failed in 2013. Had this money been invested in improving the infrastructures such as schools, colleges and hospitals, this would have benefited the masses in real sense. Hence, space industry does not deserve to be invested in.\n\nTo conclude, it seems to me that instead of wasting financial resources on space programmes, they should be rather dedicated to community projects which could benefit individuals in real life."},{"question":"Many people assume that the goal of every country should be produce more materials and goods.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Due to the competition to become number one manufacturer in the world, there has been considerable changes in the area of production. It is believed by some that every country around the globe should focus on the production of many more materials and goods than ever before. This essay completely agrees with this statement and will suggest some reasons to support my view.\n\nFrom one perspective, producing materials or goods on large portions can be advantageous for country's economy. This is true for the reason that if the government kept manufacturing the goods , they might be exported to another country, after meeting the targets of manufacturer country's citizens. As a result, the economy would increase through the money coming from exporting goods. For a case in point, a survey conducted by Cambridge university showed that if the country increases the production of materials, GDP of the country will rise by 15%. Thus, it is clear why high level of production of goods should be encouraged.\nAnother point. to consider is that by generating more materials, the country may easy the problem of unemployment rates and create more job opportunities.\n\nThis is mainly because, jobs are the main sources of income for the majority of households and of a great importance in poverty alleviation. In other words, more people escape from joblessness to ensure the stable living for their families. Uzbekistan is a good example of this, by generating more goods , a colossal amount of job -hunters was employed in 2015. Therefore, the creation of employment opportunities is essential in achieving poverty reduction.\n\nAs has been shown, I totally agree that producing materials on large quantities should be welcomed because of the fact it may create more job opportunities and boost the economy of every country."},{"question":"being celebrity such as famous film star or sport personality brings problems as well as benefits.\ndo you think that being a celebrity brings more benefit or more problem?","answer":"Famous iconic stars; actors and sports personalities, received a lot of advantages through their work, but face problems as well. Despite having no privacy is the biggest issue faced by celebrities, I believe financial security is the main factor that outweigh any problem.\n\nThe main disadvantage of living a celebrity lifestyle is lack of privacy. Due to extreme amount of following, a famous star is remain under the newspaper's highlight, where his personal life style being discussed all the time. In order to get business electronic and print media make stories and keep on discussing their private life. For example, Imran Khan, a famous sports icon, remained under scandals during his whole professional career and being judged by society all the time negatively. However , I believe that this is the minor issue that could be regulated as monitery consideration has prime importance in anyone's life.\n\nFinancial stability is one of the biggest benefit that is brought by fame. This is because successful sportsmen and film stars earn a lot of money in their short career, whereas any other profession such as doctors and engineers could not earn that much in their whole life. Being able to buy anything or travel anywhere because of high amount of salaries, results a sense of secured future among famous celebrities. For example, Justin Bieber, a renowned musician is earning more than enough at an early age that no other academic professional of his same age could reach there.\n\nTo conclude, remain in limelight around the world, results in no private life, is the main problem faced by stars, I believed that they earn more than enough amount of money during their short careers that undermine any issue faced by them."},{"question":"In recent years, many small local shops hahve closed because customers travel to large shopping centres or malls to do their shopping\nIs this a positive or a negative development?","answer":"Many claim that, recently, customers have been shopping at colossal shopping malls, and this has resulted in closure of numerous petty local stores. In my opinion, this transition will be considered as a negative development, because it will drain away the income of many middle-class local storekeepers and make customers pay much more price for the products as well.\n\nFirstly, when such a changeover happens, the renevue of those small stores falls drastically which in turn forces the owners to close the stores and look out for other works.This not only affects the owners and leave the\u200fir life unstable without regular income but also pushes out their workers.These workers are then left helpless and they suffer a lot without food and money until they find another reasonable job which is a himalayan task to them.A recent survey shows that 80% of the workers who start their career in small stores as an adult continues to do similar jobs all through their life as they do not have the knowledge, background or exposure to external world. When such a local small store is closed, the life of their workers turns out to be painful as they do not know anything other than that work.\n\nSecondly, the prices at lavish shopping malls are found to be more than the local stores and this would be an additional burden to general public.A recent study about shopping depicts that 78% of the purchases being made in stupendous shopping malls are by upper class people whose income is very high.These people do not find time to go to different local stores for purchases, and hence they find it comfortable to have all their shopping being done in a single place even at the expense of higher costs.But, when the local small shops are closed, the middle class would be forced to shop at malls which would be expensive to them.When this happens, the most affected category will be the poor ones. They have no other go than to beg around the malls for food and survival.\n\nTo summarise, this change of shopping from locally-owned small stores to corporate-owned shopping malls is a serious degradation for the country which will result in accumulation of wealth in the hands of rich people and deprivation of basic needs of the poor as per the saying \"The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer\"."},{"question":"At the present time, the population of some countries include a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of older people.\nDo the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?","answer":"The distribution of age and gender in the population has always been a concern for any country. While having a majority of the people in their childhood and teenage years may have a good outlook for the future, it may also bring problems in the present. Let us look at both sides of the coin.\n\n\"The youth is the hope of the country.\" This quote was once said by the national hero of the Philippines, Dr. Jose Rizal. This quote along with the young millionaires and billionaires, including Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, gives us much hope in the potential of young people. Children greatly influence their parents in the purchasing choices of a household, which explains the multi-million advertisements aimed at young people - from toys, candies, juice drinks to gadgets and clothes. Add to that, the economic sustenance that a young population can do to a country, is great reason enough to favor a young population.\n\nHowever, the government spending for a non-income generating population would put a strain on the national budget. Children easily catch viruses and diseases due to their still developing immune systems. While vaccines are there for prevention, still, getting sick cannot be prevented altogether. Hospitalization and education, the two most basic needs of the new generation would need to be met by the parents and the government in order to preserve the future leaders and workers. While the governments needs to allocate funds for the sustenance of the youth, they can do it through proper budgeting of taxes. They can also heavily tax on tobaccos and sugar products like candies to prevent lung disease and diabetes, especially among teenagers and children.\n\nThe future versus today. While a lot should be invested in order to feed, educate and make sure that young people are healthy at the present, it is a good investment that would surely reward a nation's tomorrow. In conclusion, a youthful population brings more advantages for a country because they are the future builders of a nation."},{"question":"Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?","answer":"In this modern world, museums are the only place where ancient goods are stored. Although, it is still debatable that either entry in museums should be charged or not. It is clear that the disadvantages of charging people for entry in museums outweigh the advantages. This essay will put light on the positive aspects of free admission as well as the negatives aspects of charged entrance.\n\nMaking museums free of cost will not only help people in learning history but also helps them in understanding art and culture of a specific area. For example, when a group of school children visited the Sindh Museum, they saw many ancient writings and jewellery, which forced them to learn about its history. As the cinemas are popular these days, if museums will be free then more and more people will visit and understand culture, tradition and history of their area.\n\nOn the other hand, charging on museums will further reduce their importance, as they are many other entertainment spots that attract the people. For instance, according to a recent report, the growth of clubs, pubs, cinemas and parks have decreased the value of museums. As there are many types of sources through which people spend their time, additional charges on museums admission will greatly decrease their value.\n\nIn conclusion, allowing people to visit these museums for learning will help people understand their history. So, the disadvantages of charging museums outweigh the advantages. It is recommended that the government should take steps to promote museums so that our history and civilisation remain intact."},{"question":"Prevention is better than cure. Researching and treating diseases is too costly so it would be better to invest in preventive measures. To what extent do you agree?","answer":"It is true that good amount of money and efforts are invested to do the research and treatment of various diseases, therefore, some preventive measures are certainly required to tackle them. I firmly agree that it is of significant importance to take some important measures that could prevent different ailments to occur.\n\nThere is a substantial amount of finance needed to research about the diseases, which adds the financial liability on the country where such diseases randomly occur. Further, not only does it requires good amount of infrastructure, but also human resources are involved to conduct extensive researches. Moreover, when any research fails, it needs substantial amount of money, effort, and different resources to start all over again, which could be significantly used on other useful areas such as education, sports or development of a nation. For instance, a recent study has shown that only half of the total amount spent on research and treatment of the diseases can be used for overall prevention programs and their implementation in a country. Lastly, the valuable time is required for doing a research and the unpredictability of its success afterwards is a major problem. \n\nTo eradicate such problem, various methods have been already adopted so far by the government, but they have a low success rate. I believe that there are far more benefits of implementing the precautionary measures for eradicating the diseases. Firstly, knowledge of preventive measures would prohibit the diseases to occur, thus ensuring healthy living for all. To start such knowledge programs, the government could take some initiatives to raise awareness among masses on how to prevent the diseases. For example, various mediums can be utilized to increase the basic knowledge of preventing diseases through the usage of media, newspapers, and education. As a result, the rising awareness among people would definitely decrease the disease occurrence rate, thereby, ensuring disease free environment and long life of individuals. Secondly, the increasing death rate due to deadly diseases would dramatically fall, and this will certainly add to stability in the population rate. Lastly, the vast amount of money that is spent on treating the diseases could be effectively used in implementing their precautionary techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, I completely believe that precautionary measures of diseases plays a vital role in making the nation disease free, for effective utilization of human resources, and to ensure healthy living for all."},{"question":"Online shopping is increasing dramatically. How could this trend affect our environment and the kind of jobs required?","answer":"With the advancement in technology, the trend of shopping over the Internet has become increasingly common. This trend contributed positively to our environment. Along with that, it affected the job market as well. Both aspects shall be discussed in this essay.\n\nShopping online is a positive development for our environment. It reduces the major issues of congestion on roads and pollution from cars. According to a recent survey, due to this trend, many people avoid going to a retail store and mostly shop online which leads to a reduction of environmental issues such as pollution, emission of harmful greenhouse gases and traffic. To illustrate, during festivals or season clearance sales many people rush to the stores, which leads to traffic jam, release of gasses from private vehicles. Thus, now with the help of shopping websites which are easily accessible to all, many people avoid visiting markets which in turn reduces the environmental problems.\n\nBesides, electronic commerce market requires jobs which are very different from the regular jobs which retailer requires. For example, majority of the employers in this field are equipped with IT and marketing skills, the jobs they need are related to computer, software or web designing, whereas retailers require different jobs such as sale person. According to New York Times, the employment ratio has declined after the increasing online shopping trend because they don't require many people, every detail is available over the website so salesman or representative person is not needed.\n\nTo conclude, this approach of shopping has made our environment better by reducing air pollution and traffic issues, but it has a dramatic impact on the job market. Labour jobs have declined and only technical jobs are needed."},{"question":"IN SOME COUNTRIES, MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO LIVE ALONE NOW A DAYS THAN IN PAST. DO YOU THINK IT IS A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT OR A NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT?","answer":"It cannot be denied that the number of people who prefer to live alone has increased. While some believe that it is has positive aspects, I think overall it is a negative development.\n\nSolitary living is thought to have some benefits. When a person lives alone, he experiences a sense of freedom as there is nobody to interrupt him in any of his likings. This is believed to make the person more focused on his work and more productive. A recent German study has shown a strong correlation between professional success and the liberty to exercise freedom at home. In addition, living by themselves, people have a broader experience of life. Having lived alone, one has to look after his finances, health and social relationships all by himself. This makes the person more capable to manage such things as compared to someone living in a large family.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that the drawback of living alone are much more. Without having somebody to talk to in residence, people have the tendency to constantly think over their minor problems and obstacles. The resulting stress is attributable to many medical conditions such as depression, suicidal attempts and panic attacks. Besides, solitary living deprives one from the care of family members especially at times of ill health. For instance, my cousin who lived alone in Pokhara sustained a fracture of his hand last year. Because he couldn\u2019t take care of the fracture alone, he had had some complication costing amputation of his right hand. Lastly, people living on themselves, do not like being advised upon life matters, thus having problems maintaining personal relationships in long term.\n\nIn conclusion, while I understand that there are both benefits and harms of living alone, I believe that the benefits eclipse the demerits, and opine that overall living alone is a negative development."},{"question":"Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world. Is it a positive or negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","answer":"It is true that because of globalization and the availability of branded products globally, nations around the globe have appeared to look alike. While there are many benefits of globalization, I would argue that it is overall a negative development. The establishment of multinational companies gives lots of benefits. \n\nFirstly, it provides job opportunities to a huge number of local people who would otherwise have had hard time to get a secure job. Secondly, it ensures the costumers that the same quality of goods are available irrespective of the geographical diversity. Lastly, making branded products available globally means that new styles and designs of products are available letting the costumers keep up with the latest trend in fashion. For instance, when there outlets of \u2018Rebook\u2019 brand in different countries, people have the opportunity to purchase the same quality of products, and even of the latest model.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that being able to purchase the same products globally has its drawbacks. The sales of locally made products are bound to fall as they cannot compete with the huge multi-national companies that tend to invest thousands, if not millions of dollars in advertisement campaigns globally. The decline in the trade of local products in long term also translates into loss of hundreds of years of culture and loss of heritage of that locality. A Norwegian research has recently shown that the establishment of outlets selling \u2018Nike\u2019 caps in the state of Punjab in India has created such a craze in the youths there that they have abandoned wearing their traditional turbans; thus harshly affecting their culture.\n\nIn conclusion, while I recognize the possible benefits of having multinational companies and the facility to buy same quality of products worldwide, I consider it to be a negative development."},{"question":"Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this statement?","answer":"Whether more money should be allocated on railways or new roads be constructed by the government will be discussed thoroughly in this essay.\n\nAmong some circles it is believed that new railways should be built and the old one should be maintained. They argue that doing so not only encourages people to use public transportation thus making contributions to decrease environmental pollutions including green-house gases emitted by burning fossil fuels by personal cars but also saving a huge amounts national budget otherwise spent on maintenance of roads which tends to be much higher than those of railroads. For instance, the United States of America in which most of people drive to work, the environment is nowhere near as clean as it is in Japan, whose people prefer public transportation over personal ones.\n\nOn the other hand, other people oppose the idea, contending that every single person deserves the right to choose the way he\/she travel whether it is personal cars or trains and metros and reckon that railroads cannot be a substitute for roads this soon. For example people in USA believe that they have to walk long distances from the metro stops to work unless they travel by their own cars, resulting in wasting much time.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly support the idea of building more railways and metros which helps conserves the precious resources such as energy thus helping our blue planet to stay clean and green and allowing reverse the damages we, humans, have done to it."},{"question":"Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience","answer":"It is true that several language become extinct each year. While some people believe that it makes our life simpler and easier, I do not agree with this opinion and argue that preservation of languages is important.\n\nPeople have opinion that dying out of less used languages is a positive development. This helps develop a particular language, say for instance, English, gain more popularity making communication easier. Having a specific tongue that is understood by all means that there is very less likelihood of being misunderstood and that there are virtually no barriers to expression of thoughts or ideas.\n\nIn contrast, I believe that language is more than just a form of communication; it is enriched with history, culture creating a taste for other languages as well. Firstly, dialects spoken in a geographical territory can help us understand about the past of the region. In case the language dies out, it becomes next to impossible to understand the manuscripts that could possibly be found during research and extraction in future. In addition, the similarity in scripts and languages reinforce to understand each other\u2019s\u2019 cultures. For example, the same Devnagari font used in the different regions of the Indian sub-continent has helped us have a deeper understanding of the evolution of similar culture in the region. \n\nFinally, having multiple languages means that there are variations in speech and the world does not look alike. This creates a sense of curiosity among people having different tongues. A Swedish study has shown that the more interactions between people of European nations is attributable to the variation in their languages.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are arguments that having a universal language is more beneficial, I disagree with the view and believe that lingual diversity has its benefits and should be preserved."},{"question":"today the high sale of popular goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold . To which extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Advertising industry has flourished in this century beyond our wildest expectations. Nowadays, even it is claimed that marketing campaigns are the real force behind surge in the sale of renowned products rather than real need of society. In my opinion, I strongly agree that advertisement is the key to increase market share in this era.\n\nCompanies manipulate the mind of customers by advertising products in such an effective manner that people assume it to be necessary for themselves. They are attracted by the benefits, which are spotlighted in advertisements without considering their actual demand in real life. For instance, fizzy drinks are not the actual need of society, especially in hot weather. \n\nHowever, the Advertisement of these drinks portraits them as a best solution to fulfill thirst demand of human body in hot weather, regardless of their detrimental impact on body. As a result sale of these drinks touches the pinnacles in summer. Thus, it is quite evident that advertisement has a significant role in increasing the sale of product. Moreover, some companies often manipulate the affection and emotional bonding of people towards their stars to enhance the sale of product by hiring these celebrities as a brand ambassador. People assume these products of good quality, as their super stars advertise them. As a result, masses purchase these items without considering their needs.\n\nIn conclusion, undoubtedly, advertisement has a paramount role in enhancing sale of any product without considering the real demand of society by presenting products in a conducive way as well as by hiring glamorous people as brand ambassador. This trend will not be stopped in nearly foreseeable future."},{"question":"Some believe that unpaid community service should be compulsory part of high school programmes(for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children.To what extend do you agree or disagree?","answer":"People's opinions differ as to whether or not high school curriculum should make helping the community as a mandatory aspect of education.I am of the wavelength that such a work should be a compulsion for the younger generation.\n\nFirstly, a coursework like this helps adolescents to commune with their society and this acts as an instrument in creating a feeling of ownership.By engaging in these activities young people gain hands on experience which goes a long way.As a stark example, the culture of old age home is prevalent now in all parts of the world.If tender minds get a chance to work here they would get sensitise to this issue and would grow as adults who donot abandon their parents.So, the above example clearly shows the need of free societal work for students.\n\nIn addition to this, foundation of relationships are laid which makes individuals feel that they are accepted by the society.The inner happiness that is attained by making a change in somebody's life cannot be achieved by any worldly things.For example,if a renowned sportsperson starts training kids of his neighbourhood he would get more respect and love that boosts self confidence and gives a feeling of achievement.Not only this,such work experience helps in dealing with situations later in professional life as one has the skills to deal people. Thus after analysing, it is evident that introducing volunteer work for students is laden with multiple benefits.\n\nAs the discussion reveals, making students do free work for community will not only help children to grow but even the society.I hope governments the world over encourage such a trend."},{"question":"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree","answer":"It is suggested by some people that, Social work should be made an oligation by high schools. I strongly favour this opinion. The reason is by making it compulsory students can learn a great deal about their community. Not only this, it will help them in employment and experience gaining.\n\nMajority of youngsters,nowadays, are not observed to be involved in social services voluntarily. By making it a compulsion, students will follow it. This will raise awareness and people who are not bound to do it would also follow thier footsteps. There are several benefits of such programs, For instance, students will get to learn about other people in society, about their needs and problems. By helping such people, young ones will develop a feeling of empathy and compassion and they turn out to be better individuals in future.\n\nMoreover, programmes like these are extremely beneficial in reducing inactivity level among students. It promotes thier working skills making them self reliant. Students after doing unpaid services do not earn money but they earn experience which helps them in future employment. To illustrate, a study was published that graduates who actively involved in social work during their high school period received better opportunities and they performed very well in their workplace. They also got chances to get enrolled in higher studies becaus of thier much stronger CV.\n\nTo conclude, there are myriad of benefits of community service programmes. It not only helps pupil learn how to take care of others but also boost their future opportunities. This is why making it compulsory would be best for them as well as for society. This trend should be widely promoted."},{"question":"Online shopping is replacing shopping in stores.Do you think it is a positive or a negative developmet.","answer":"With recent advancements in the field of technology , there has been an increase in buying things online rather than in traditional shops. I believe this change in shopping attitude has certain merits however, the negative impact on economy is something which should not be overlooked. The following essay will first discuss why I consider online shopping a positive change and later state my views about the negative effects of this trend on financial state of any nation.\n\nConvenience and low price of consumer products is what is a major advantage of online shopping. Firstly, with busy life schedules , it is not possible for many people to take time out in order to visit shops or stores to purchase items. Online shopping websites, thereby, provide a suitable alternative where one can select and purchase the products of one\u2019s liking and need without even leaving the comforts one\u2019s home or workplace.Low asking price of various items is another reason why people prefer to shop on internet. Unlike traditional retailors , online websites do not have to rent or buy space in order to display their items, this in turn decreases the extra taxes which are a norm in traditional stores. Hence, decreasing the overall cost of the products. The price difference in in-store and online websites of numerous famous retailors such as John Lewis, which can sometime be as high as 10 percent, clearly illustrates this argument.\n\nWhile I accept the aforementioned benefits, I believe that negative influence of this trend on state economy should be acknowledged. As more individuals opt to buy items online, it has been observed that sales and ultimately revenue of certain traditional stores is experiencing a decline. And since all would agree that these businesses are the backbone of a nation\u2019s economy, it ultimately deteriorates the financial situation of the state. Taking example of Norway, where a recent surge in internet shopping has put various retail shops out of business.Thus, increasing unemployment and harmfully impacting the economic growth of the country.It is clear that purchasing items online runs the risk of harming the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the convenience and low asking price I believe internet shopping is a positive development. Nevertheless, I also think that influence on financial situation of a nation is what makes it a negative trend."},{"question":"Please do evaluate this task 2 essay and comment on the probable band score.\nSome say that music, art and drama are as important as other school subjects,especially at primary level. Do you agree or disagree?","answer":"It is argued that introducing various art forms like music, drama, art, etc into a primary curriculum is as important as other subjects. This essay strongly agrees to this view firstly as primary schooling is the best phase for children to learn something new and secondly, this also contributes to their all-round development.\n\nChildren at primary level are the most receptive to new knowledge. It is said that our brain activity is the best between the ages of five and eleven. Hence, if taught during this period we tend to memorise more efficiently. Moreover, exposing children to various art forms at an early age not only helps them realise their passion but also their inherent talent. A recent study in Italy stated that 36% of the most famous singers were practicing since they were in primary school proving that their efficiency improved a great deal by starting early as this gives a strong foundation.\n\nLearning different art forms also caters to an all-round development of the child. This not only boosts their confidence but also helps them overcome their inferiority complexes and stage fears. Indulging in extracurricular activities reduces stress and also helps the pupils focus better on their own subjects at school. Hence, this proves advantageous to their professional career. For instance, a survey conducted by University of Michigan in 2016 stated that 65% of the most eminent personalities in the field of business attributed their success to the knowledge they gained in school outside their classroom by indulging in various extracurricular activities.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion primary education is the best time for a child to start learning an art form and it is mandatory to add them to their curriculum along with other subjects as they help in a child's overall development."},{"question":"Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are to buy the same products anywhere in the world.\nPositive or negative?","answer":"Today, globalization has created new perspectives of how the world goes as one global family who speaks one language. Some argue this has allowed many cultures and economies to die out, while others believe it has encouraged much more freedom to the global family. It is, thus, agreed that such ideology has more positive implications than negative. This will be proven by looking at how sharing one global market helps in raising people\u2019s living standards and begets freer communities.\n\nPrimarily, globalization and the advent of technology do impact the global family when it comes to purchasing. For example, companies such as: Amazon, Adidas, Apple and Samsung, they share their products around the world by franchising in other countries or using online marketing. This exhibition to consumer goods is allowing people to buy the products they get attracted to, regardless the country of origin or its provenance. As a result, a person in a developing nation may have the same possessions of those in rich countries, which in turn enhance living standards of people who live in poorer communities.\n\nFurthermore, the global economy and cultural exchange between nations have positive effects to release international tension and create freer societies. Take, the twentieth century, as an example. Had people bought all the commodities they need and not available in the local market, less conflicts and disputes would have never occurred. This happened in tandem with people\u2019s eagerness to exploit others\u2019 wealth. It is, therefore, clear why the availability to buy products worldwide has its merits. This proves how such arrangement is beneficial to release international tensions and create freer communities.\n\nTo sum up, it is obvious that global economy and relative similarity between countries have positive ramifications.

Some people feel that government should ban smoking entirely. Do you agree or disagree?","answer":"People smoke, be it in a form of cigarette, tobacco or e-cigarettes, for a variety of reasons. It could be as a means of stress relief, for pleasure or just when they are in a social situation. Many nations have already taken the initiative to at least limit smoking in it's people. These countries, in an effort to reduce the negative consequences brought about by smoking, have came up with ways in which to make people cut back on this addictive habit, I should say that smoking should be banned not only in public places but should be everywhere entirely.\n\nIt has been known that there is huge correlation of smoking to lung cancer and most cardio-pulmonary diseases in the human body. The nicotine and tar, among which are the main hazardous components of each cigarette sticks, that one can get when the fumes are inhaled, are the ones responsible for the harmful effects, as these are toxic to the body. Even if these facts are made aware to the public with all the health-related advertisements and gentle reminders, people still have the choice to continue smoking, given that these products are just readily available for purchase in most retail stores.\n\nMoreover, in the scope of environmental issues, the people are made aware of the damages inflicted by the tobacco industry go far beyond the effects of the smokes that cigarettes put into the air as when they are inhaled in the body. The industry itself and the production of them, accounts for the deforestation, climate change, cigarette butt litters and wildfires, which all have damaging impact to nature. They create environment hazards beginning from the use of pesticides, fertilizers, toxic chemicals that depletes the soil of its nutrients. Added to the list is that tobacco cultivation and farming balded our forests leading to hotter climate or global warming. The trash created by cigarette butts is also destroying our oceans and poisoning our marine animals.\n\nIn conclusion, a day would not be enough to discuss why smoking should be banned entirely. And it is just right when sometimes, the government will put the reins in it's own hands and induce measures in putting a stop to smoking by banning it entirely. This way, mortality rates from smoking-related illnesses will be significantly reduced and the environments will be much more conducive and healthier place for all it's inhabitants to live in as well as for the next generation of human race to come."},{"question":"Healthcare should not be provided for free regardless of a person's income. The health of an individual is in their own hands. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","answer":"Healthcare is a massively important aspect of any society and should not be tackled lightly. While some people believe that each citizen should be held accountable for their own health status and ought to pay for healthcare regardless of their income, I side with those who feel that health is a basic right and, therefore, should be available to everyone for a number of reasons, some of which I demonstrate below.\n\nFirstly, not every disease is caused by human behaviour. Some people argue that numerous individuals voluntarily engage in unhealthy lifestyles, such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol, frequently ending up with lung cancer or other preventable devastating diseases, which require highly expensive treatments. However, a variety of illnesses are congenital or genetic, which means they cannot be avoided by pursuing healthy lifestyles. Type 1 diabetes is a good illustration of this as it results from a genetic predisposition; therefore, people who suffer from this disease, the majority of them being children, cannot be held accountable for it.\n\nAnother key reason that illustrates how crucial it is to have a free healthcare system has to do with economics. If someone is ill and cannot afford to go to the hospital, it is highly probable that, without the required remedies, they will be absent from work for longer periods of time. Hence, companies may have to pay for temporary workers to cover for their absent employees, rising the monthly expenses for the institution and, possibly, reducing the work productivity as the new worker is bound to lack enough training for the job he or she is asked to perform.\n\nIn conclusion, not only may a fully paid healthcare system negatively impact companies financially, but it would also handle situations where people have congenital or genetic diseases rather unfairly. Therefore, I strongly disagree that healthcare should be paid by everyone, regardless of their income."},{"question":"The rise of convenience food has helped people keep up with the speed of modern lifestyle. Do the advantages outweighs the disadvantages.","answer":"advantages outweighs the disadvantages.\nThe increasing trend of ready-made food has helped people to keep up with their fast-paced lifestyle. In my opinion, it brings about more health problems than any advantage it might bring.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some basic benefits of convenience food such as they are easy to prepare and consume far less time than traditional cooking. To illustrate, this food method is very accessible for students who are living in a hostel and find it difficult to cook meals, they can spend more time in education if they opt for ready made food. Likewise, working women's also find instant meals a better option this way they can spend their maximum time at the workplace and become more productive.\n\nNevertheless, despite the advantages above, I Believe people could face serious health issues with the consumption of such food items. One potentially dangerous problem is that ready made food is high in sodium and saturated fats which causes high blood pressure and obesity. According to recent research published in the American health journal, that increase child obesity and diabetes is because of dramatically high intake of fast food. Also, ready made food is added with preservatives and additives ,to prevent them from spoilage, and some of them are cancer causing. Thus, it is evident that they are harmful to health.\n\nIn conclusion, being physically ill or struggling with health problems far outweighs any of the minor benefits of time-saving."}]},{"title":"Advantage & Disadvantages","content":[{"question":"In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.","answer":"People in a few countries support adults to do job or take tour after completing their Intermediate-level education for period of a year. This essay will discuss that how it will be beneficial to select right field for study before taking admission to universities also, how it will affect on their job in future, and giving less amount of time to serve their country.\n\nOn the one hand, the main advantage of giving pupils free hand for one year to work or travel will be helpful in choosing proper field of study. Thus, they will then work in that field with the core of their heart. For instance, a person who has little bit time for choosing his future field might select the course which society wants, not according to his wish, so giving them 12 months for work and travel around country will place mirror in front of them and will teach that what they have actually made for. In addition, having practical knowledge regarding subject which they will seek in university is really good to have, they will not require more time to study this particular subject.\n\nOn the other hand, as we know everything has two sides, this is not an exceptional case. Everyones life period is not fixed, it is however, pre-written, it will be better to use it by giving service to beloved country rather than wasting on tours. Let us take and example of our country Pakistan, according to our countrys constitution: no one could do job after 60 years of age. Thus, wasting time on tour will affect their job in future as they have spend one year on doing work or take tours which means they will be given one year less to serve their country.\n\nOn balance, sometimes it is beneficial to take gape of one year in between High school and third-level institute in order to select right field for study, but also it has disadvantage of wasting one year on tour and work as in results you will be given opportunity to serve your country for less amount of time."},{"question":"Many high school students take part time jobs.what are the advantages and disadvantages of this .","answer":"It is a common practice nowadays for high school students to get a part time job,either for financial reasons or to acquire professional life skills.This ever increasing trend has,undoubtedly,many benefits;however,this may bring some negative ramifications with it.This essay will look at the positive and negative sides of such a practice .\n\nTo begin, high school students can benefit from a part time employment in so many ways.Firstly , it helps them all,especially the poor ones,to become financially independent ,meaning that they no longer need to rely on their parents or family for day_to_day needs.Also,being independent develops a sense of responsibility which may be proven extremely helpful in later life.In addition to this ,having a part time job would mean following a daily hectic routine and managing the stress of a job,which makes them strong enough to face the challenges of practical life.\n\nHowever, it is not wrong to say that such a practice has devastating consequences on academic progress of high school children.It is obvious that students have to dedicate a great deal of time to their work,leaving them with barely any time to concentrate on their studies.As a result,their performance at school suffers badly.A study in China proves this by unveiling their results; a staggering number of students with poor academic results were those with part time job.Hence, it is clear that such a trend can affect students in a negative way.\n\nTo conclude, doing a part time employment has many benefits like financial stability and development of mental strength for the future.However, the major drawback( poor academic performance) is not to be ignored."},{"question":"Nowadays, people are living an increasingly longer life and in many countries there are more old people than young people.What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?","answer":"It is an undeniable fact that the life expectancy of human race has increased over the past few decades and many nations have high number of graying population as compared to the younger generation.There are both advantages and disadvantages of this trend which I shall discuss in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nThere are a number of benefits associated with having more number of ageing population.First and foremost, elders are source of support for many young families.To cite an example of this,they take care of their children and provide them with the love and affection which they themselves cannot offer to their young kids due to the hectic schedules.Moreover,old people have more experience which is useful for youngsters to face challenges of life.Elders have already gone through thick and thin of life and hence, they can help young people to stay motivated and can offer assistance.\n\nHaving said that, there are a number of drawbacks also associated with having ageing population in a country.To begin with,aged people do not earn and are dependent on the government for retirement and health benefits.This puts a lot of strain on health care system and economy of the nation.Furthermore,many developed countries such as Australia and Canada are facing issues with ageing population as there are very less number of people paying taxes. As a result, they have started immigration programs to invite skilled workers from all over the world to sustain their economies.\n\nIn conclusion,ageing is an inescapable part of life.cAlthough it has demerits and can hit the economy of a nation,there are merits also which young generation can take advantage of."},{"question":"In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university.\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of this?","answer":"Undoubtedly, the pre-university year is regarded as one of the most shining and effective period in youngsters\u2019 life that should be well-exploited. Working in this year could help students to find out the requirements of work environment facilitating their choices for university classes and yet, there are drawbacks to be taken into account.\n\nOn the one hand, experiencing the work fields or travelling prior to university admission is advantageous. Firstly, young adults will encounter the exact needs of employment before joining the universities. This will help them to determine courses and classes that they must take during their university period, allowing them to reach their ultimate goals and find the suitable career. Secondly, Travelling to foreign nations could bring about a lot of changes in their mentality, personality and the way they think.

This, accordingly, will open up new horizons making their university period a way to achieve their dreams.\n\nOn the other hand, wasting a year after high school has drawbacks. One problem is that this period is considered critical in young adults\u2019 life in which they may involve in actions that change their life topsy-turvy namely: crimes. For example, a study revealed that crime rate is 30 % higher among students with a gap between school and university .therefore, their careers will be permanently affected. Another possible issue is that it could be just a waste of time delaying their university graduation. Consequently, they will lose a lot of opportunities to join the work forces as the market becomes more competitive with a lot of graduates every year.\n\nIn conclusion, having a one-year-gap prior to university could bring a lot of merits. However, a lot of youngsters may waste this year and even involve in actions against law."},{"question":"Today more and more tourists are visiting places where conditions are difficult, such as the Sahara desert or the Antarctic?\nWhat are the benefits and disadvantages for tourists who visit such places?","answer":"Many visitors are showing their interest to visit troublesome places, like Sahara deserts or the Antartic, at the present time. Tourists could get exciting experiences from an adventurous trip, but there are many drawbacks to be taken into account.\n\nFirstly, one of the advantages of touring in challenging place is that it is full of adventure. Those who travel regularly may get bored by seeing normal tourist spots so that an adventurous journey can become a blessing for them. Secondly, an extreme place often offers the opportunity to enjoy the natural beauty closely. For example, to see the Royal Bengal Tiger in Sunderban, one might have to stay in the deep wood for a couple of days which could be very interesting but not out of danger. So, it is clear that dangerous places have many things to offer for the fearless sightseers.\n\nOn the other hand, a major problem of traveling in an awkward place is that there could be no facilities for tourists. Not only the transportation is a chief problem, but also the communication system is very poor in this area. For example, on the peak of the Mount Everest, if a person needs instant medical help, it will be very difficult for him to communicate to get an air ambulance. In some places, other facilities like food or security are totally difficult to provide. There is no doubt that the travelers need to be prepared mentally to face any unwanted situations.\n\nIn conclusion, although some people are interested to have an adventurous journey by moving into a place where conditions are risky, its disadvantages, such as no medical support or no security, should not be ignored."}]},{"title":"Problem & Solution","content":[{"question":"In many countries schools have problems with student behavior.\nWhat do you think are the causes of this ?\nWhat solutions can you suggest?","answer":"Many educational institutions in the world are suffering from poor behavior of adolescents. There is no doubt that it really exists. There are few factors behind this, and of course, a number of approaches also exist to tackle this situation. \n\nFirstly, unexpected poor behavior of young children in school is due to lack of communication with their parents at home because of their busy schedule thus, most of the time they are engaged with their friends rather than with family. They use to follow either one of them family or gathering at a time, if they are not feeling friendly with their ancestors they will surely adopt their friends ideology instead, which lead them to characterless student. Secondly, social medias effect on their mind, it is increasing day by day and they use their precious time surfing sites like Facebook, Insta, and Twitter. It is known fact that a person who makes interaction with his society is more likely a respectable citizen in comparison with such Internet addicted person. These sites no doubt, make them able to be in touch with their loved ones but also are root problem of their isolation, these sites actually disconnect them from real world thus, they lose moral values of teachers.\n\nTurning to its solutions, first of all, parents should spend time with their children instead of being busy all the time and make a chemistry of friendship along with proper guidance regarding moral values of teachers and make them away from those friends whose ideologies are totally different because parents are considered as first teachers of their children, what they seek under their guidance having friendly bond , will never forget in future. Additionally, there must be time table for using internet so these websites could not affect on their mind.

What are the causes? What solutions can you suggest?","answer":"In recent years, the global safety rates have somewhat decreased. As a result, it is now argued that individuals do not feel secure neither indoors nor outdoors. This essay will examine the roots of this problem and suggest some steps that could be taken towards tackling the issue.\n\nThere are several factors contributing to the general insecurity among people. What lies at the bottom of the problem is a gap between the wealthy and impoverished that has been widening for a long time. Since the poor cannot find a job to provide for their families, they are now more inclined than ever to commit a crime. For example, crimes such as robbery or burglary have become one of the most used means of livelihood, eventually causing an insecurity. Apart from this, currently in many countries, the large number of vehicles create massive traffic jams which in turn makes the roads too dangerous for children to play outside. As a consequence, a sense of security is declining which makes it clear that a danger is becoming apparent in light of numerous factors.\n\nHowever, some measures can be taken in order to overcome this problem, thus ensuring the safety. This could be addressed by opening up some job training sessions for those unemployed people living in abject poverty. Needless to say, if the poor were provided with suitable jobs to eke out a living, this would obviate the need to perpetrate a crime. On top of that, some surveillance cameras could be introduced to crime prone areas that are also thronged with people so that this would serve as a deterrent to other would-be offenders. This has been most effective in Finland, where having been installed, those security cameras prevented many felonies, hence ensuring a safe environment for people. As this shows, this is a problem that could successfully be dealt with, if prompt actions were taken.\n\nIn conclusion, while the need to make a living and a huge traffic congestion are the main precursors of the problem of incessant danger, some measures such as creating new job vacancies for the poor and setting up monitoring cameras would certainly help to cope with the very problem."},{"question":"Every country has poor people and every country has different ways of dealing with the poor. What are some of the reasons for poverty? What can we do to help the poor?\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","answer":"Poverty is a major dilemma as it is faced by both the developing and developed world however, this is more serious in third world nations. This can be attributed to many factors and there can be certain solutions to tackle poor conditions promptly.\n\nThe population which is devoid of the basic necessities of life lacks knowledge, as mostly they do not know how to earn money. This illiteracy leads to lack of job opportunities for the most less privileged people. For instance, in South Asia the illiteracy rate is the highest when compared to the rich countries, which results in unemployment or jobs with minimum wages, causing a direct decline in income. In addition, overpopulation is another important leading factor towards the indigence because this directly affects the sources of income for most individuals. This can cause a decline in educational slots for a nations people and thus illiteracy prevails, which decreases earning options for the population. Another effect of this is that it also results in poor health conditions and therefore, more scarcity for these people.\n\nNevertheless, there are certain drastic measures which can be taken by both the government and humans to overcome this. One of them is to increase spending of the countrys budget on education. As this will lead to more facilities to teach people, it will boost literacy in the third world nations. Also, in the long term this policy can cause a surge in opportunities to employ them because of better knowledge. Governments should also adopt a policy of discouraging overpopulation by promoting campaigns against this. In this way people can better understand the drawbacks of the increased populace burden on individual and national level.\n\nHaving discussed reasons and solutions to overcome poverty, it is clear that education plays a vital role in solving this problem.

Firstly, through deforestation they are destroying the natural habitat of various animals. As the world's population is growing rapidly, there is an inevitable need to cut down trees in order to construct new residential buildings. As a result, many forests are being converted into towns and villages.Another reason behind animal extinction is over-hunting of animals .In many countries hunting is legal and people are daily killing animals just for enterrainment. The consequence of these activities is a severe decline in wild life population. \n\nTurning to possible solutions, the best approach would be for the government to deter people from clearing out trees and forests for personal benefits, like building homes and commercial markets. Therefore, the government should provide proper housing and residential apartments to all its citizens, which seems to be the only solution to accommodate a growing number of population. In addition, there should be a law against intensive farming practice in agriculture. Finally, the government must declare hunting of animals illegal, and the offenders should be heavily fined or punished. If all these measures are taken immediately, there is a great chance to save the wild life from becoming extinct.\n\nTo sum up, human beings are mainly responsible for destruction of forest and wild life . However, there are a number of measures that can be taken to deal with this problem.It is hoped that, in the future, the government and individuals will give more attention to this issue."},{"question":"Global warming is one of the biggest threats humans face in the 21st century and sea levels are continuing to rise at alarming rates.\nWhat problems are associated with this and what are some possible solutions.","answer":"Nowadays, global warming is one of the serious and biggest menace for mankind. This hazardous situation is producing greenhouse gas, which is causing calamity in the ozone layer. Moreover, ultra violet rays of sun are entering in the earth atmosphere form the porous ozone layer, and this is increasing oceans levels dramatically. This essay will analyze issues caused by the rise in water levels and their remedies, followed by a logical conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, one of the major problem is floods, which are striking coastal areas. The reason for this devastation is melting of ice glaciers in the northern and southern hemisphere. The melting down of ice is escalating due UV (Ultra Violet) rays that are uplifting the earth\u2019s temperature. Take recent downpour of United States as an example. Scientists working in metrology department have shown from statistics that these floods are hitting this belt due to disequilibrium in sea levels. Secondly, the scorching heat of sun has intensified the evaporation process in the oceans which is the main element in origination of most clouds that could shower heavy rain in the residential areas. Precisely, famine is taking place in the contemporary world due to the unstoppable and unpredictable rainy season triggering due to rise vaporization process in the sea levels.\n\nIn addition, the most effective remedial measure to curtail this risky condition is the minimization of combustion engines from the transport system. The carbon exhaust emitting form burning of fossil fuel is destroying protective atmosphere layers, and this worsening state is tamed by the utilization of Eco-friendly fuels in the modern vehicles. For instance, recent studies have shown that air pollution is minimized 40 % in ratio after the invention of solar and electric cars in the developed countries. Furthermore, proper dumping of solid waste is another way out. If concerned authorities dump the waste at the land filled toxins and bio hazards secreted from this wastage will not affect the surrounding areas.\n\nIn conclusion, global warming has raised the earth temperature which has elevated sea levels. The tidal waves and famine due to rainfall are causing the serious perils and to counter it Eco-friendly fuel, management of solid waste are its remedial actions."},{"question":"Nowadays traffic in major cities is worsening. What problems does it create? How can we help solve these problems as individuals?","answer":"Life in large urban areas is getting more and more complicated. Surging movements of vehicles in roads is often pushing an already stretched city system to a critical limit. This essay will discuss the problems caused by depressing traffic condition and put forward solutions for this aforementioned issue\n\nThe foremost complication caused by unmanaged transport system in cities is people will not be able to reach their destination on time. As because of increasing proportion of jams at different junctions of roads , they will have to waste their valuable time being stuck during rush hours. A case to illustrate this, a research conducted by Corporate forum association revealed that employees complained that approximately 3 out of 10 appointments were being missed due to the traffic issues. In addition, being stuck in traffic is an unpleasant experience, it makes people furious and this can ultimately have negative ramification in health of person.\n\nThough, solving the chaotic scenario of traffic in big metropolitans by individual\u2019s effort will be a herculean task, but still a viable panacea could be sharing the cars or bikes with colleague while traveling to and fro from office. This will to some extent play pivotal role in reducing the number of two wheelers and four wheelers in the road and as a consequence one will have to witness fewer jams. For instance carpooling and bike pooling are gaining popularity among college students and workers as it will not only lessen the traffic congestion but also save the expenditure in fuel in long run. In the same vein, another approach could be using public transport rather than own vehicle because buses and trains could accommodate large number of people in one sitting and thus will play imperative role in regulating traffic smoothly.\n\nHence, traffic congestion is one of the leading challenges we face today in conurbations, which leads to jams and indirectly affects the mental well being, but a possible solution from us could be minimizing the excessive use of private vehicle and opting for public transport service."},{"question":"More and more people prefer to read ebooks rather then paper books nowadays.\nwhat are the reasons for this ??\nwhat problems can this cause for libraries ??","answer":"In our contemporary world, majority of the people like to view books on their electronic devices in comparison to its physical forms. This essay will firstly, discuss how user friendliness is one of the primary causes of it and secondly, outline the dire ramifications it holds for libraries in the form of them being closed.\n\nThe main reason for the growth in the trend of viewing books digitally is how easy it is to find a book online as compared to its paper form. With advancements in the field of science and technology, we can view any book written by a not so famous author which would otherwise not be available in the local book shop. For example, with websites like Google books and Amazon, one can directly download or view novels which would not be found in the local library.\n\nHowever, this development has negative implications for libraries in a way that most people would abandon them. It would not make sense to waste valuable resources and efforts to visit libraries when all of the books would be available to us in our homes with all the comfort in the world .this will eventually result in libraries being shut down. Peshawar, my hometown in Pakistan is a prime example where a public library was shut down recently because it was not being utilized by the general public when e-books were introduced here.\n\nIn conclusion, the demand of books in online form can be attributed to how convenient it is for the reader to get any book and ultimately, it will have negative consequences for traditional places of reading, such as university and public libraries, resulting in them being closed."},{"question":"Production of goods has led to environmental damage\ngive causes and solution of the problem.","answer":"In the recent few decades, there is variety tremendous rise in the demand for various items, leading to a huge rise in the manufacturing of different goods. This trend has the detrimental impact on the atmosphere. In this essay, I will discuss the core factors behind this and will also suggest practical solutions to tackle the pertinent issue.\n\nThe the of the rise in the making of goods is the population explosion because an increase in a number of people around the globe will automatically raise the demand of items like clothes, household, and other goods. Therefore, it is obvious that in order to meet the demands, production unit will manufacture exorbitant numbers of goods. Another contributing factor is that most of the production units do not have a proper mechanism of waste disposal, consequently, the toxic litter and detritus containment the fresh water, which endanger the existence of aquatic species. For instance, the establishment of the industrial zone in Egypt has led to a dramatic decline in the population of swans across the Nile River. The burning of fossil fuels is also a major reason for damaging the ecosystem since industries burn fossil fuels that lead to the emission of hazardous gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxides.\n\nComing towards the remedial side, there is a plethora of solutions to counter this issue. At the first place, an effective remedy will be the adopting the concept of family planning and spreading awareness about various methods of contraception. By doing this, the population can be controlled, which mean that the production of goods will be limited. In addition, one practical solution is to seal all factories that lack proper disposal units, that will decrease the pollution of water and hence save the aquatic life. In order to mitigate the issue, the factories should be diverted to nuclear and solar , this will decrease the emission of fossil fuels.\n\nTo conclude, it\u2019s a fact that the considerable rise in the good has damaged the environment but with measures like family planning. Proper disposal units and renewable energy resources, it can be overcome."},{"question":"These days, in many countries, fewer and fewer people want to become teachers, particularly in secondary schools. What are the reasons for this, and how could the problem be solved?","answer":"Teaching is a noble profession. However, nowadays, less number of people want to pursue it as a career. Factors which have contributed to this issue are low income and great burden on secondary school teachers , but measures could be taken by government to tackle this problem.\n\nThe main reason contributing to this situation is that the pedagogical experts of post-elementary institutes are earning less income as compared to other professions. For example, in Asia, particularly in Pakistan, less number of graduates choose to become a tutor. Because in this financial climate of austerity, people give preference to job with high salaries to fulfil their desires. Whereas, the average monthly income of Pakistani teacher of secondary schools is insufficient to meet their basic requirements. They must have to do part time job along with this profession. Apart from this, students of intermediate classes require more attention. They need proper concentration and time to understand the subject . Therefore, teachers have to utilize extra mental and physical energy to wholly explain and evaluate the relevant topics to pupils . This is the second most common reason why people of most countries resist to become a tutor.\n\nThe onus is on government to handle such situations in a wise manner. The first possible solution would be the increment in the salaries of secondary school instructors. This will encourage significant number of candidates to embrace this occupation and give a better performance. Another measure to resolve the problem is by recruiting co-workers along with main class teachers. This will ultimately decrease the burden on single person and person will be able to enjoy his or her duty.\n\nTo conclude, the two prime reasons such as inadequate pay and a great work load have attributed to decrease passion of becoming a teacher. But efficient actions could be taken by state to mitigate such potential problems and foster people to join this noble profession."},{"question":"The percentage of over weighed adults in western society has increased significantly across recent generations. discuss causes and effects of this disturbing trend???","answer":"In recent decades, there has been a tremendous rise in the obesity rates of the developed world. The reasons of this expanded rise in obesity and it's outcomes will be discussed in this essay.\n\nObesity is prevalent more in the western society nowadays for the reasons stated here. One major cause is, the trend of less physical activity, owing to busy work schedules of the adults. As a result, they tend to relax in their free time than to exercise. This money-oriented society forces them to work for longer hours and shifts, without focusing on their physical fitness,that has no substitute. In addition, another leading cause of obesity, is the choice of household items high in the sugar content. To remain convenient ,over the past few years, the consumption of these sugar coated products have been increased remarkably. For instance juices, cereals and now even fat free drinks are some of it's examples.\n\nThe possible effects resulting from obesity can be discussed in the number of ways. Firstly, the sedentary life style of the adults has been ultimately leading to conditions like diabetes, stroke, hypertension and cardiac problems, which can have detrimental effects on human's health. Moreover, high sugary products have been resulting in poor dental hygiene. Recently, a huge number of children has been reported to proceed for the dental procedures in the western countries as a result of tooth decay from raised sugar consumption.\n\nIn conclusion, a desk-bound lifestyle and the poor selection of substandard sweet items are the notable causes of obesity in the developed world leading to some serious medical issues, health problems and devastating consequences."},{"question":"In many countries today, there are concerns about the unhealthy lifestyles that people lead.

This undesired change is believed to be the precursor of physical as well as psychological afflictions. However , the solution to these issues demand collective efforts on individual and government level.\n\nTo begin, there are some horrible outcomes associated with modern lifestyle. First of all, people nowadays are busy more than ever, such as in offices and business sectors. Owing to prolonged working hours , they actually cannot get time to do some exercise or relax. Therefore, becoming physically unfit seems inevitable. Furthermore, lack of healthy outdoor activities makes them liable to stress and anxiety, which often ultimately leads to depression.\n\nHowever ,the dangers of modern lifestyle can be effectively dealt with if both citizens and state are wary of its negative ramifications. Firstly, it would be quite prudent if workers schedule their time giving an importance to physical activities. To illustrate , according to some studies 15 minutes of exercise a day would be sufficient to counteract some health issues, such as cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases.Also, these simple steps seem to be enough in fighting with mental issues by keeping people engaged in healthy activities. Moreover , ruling authorities should introduce certain legislation to encourage regular exercise among people. Employees should not be allowed to work beyond 6 hours or 4 days a week. By taking these measures the above mentioned problems can easily be solved.\n\nTo conclude, it is undeniable that advancements in lifestyle have brought some crucial issues for humanity.

As a result, as currently the lands all around the globe are becoming less and less in size, the production of meat over the world should be decreased or even frowned upon. While the most practical approach to this would be to levy higher taxes on the use of vacant lands by farmers, this can result in a considerable damage to economies of the most countries in all corners of the world.\n\nThere are a number of measures that governments of every stripe can take in order to slow down the meat production. One viable way is to put relatively higher excise duties on the amount of space that farmers are allowed to use within their own countries, which comes down to the shoulders of government officials. Put simply, if one has to pay a colossal amount of money for using the lands for production, this might lead to them branching out to other modes of business, thus leaving their current work. A good example is the Netherlands where an average farmer is required to pay extra 5000$ for each hectare added to the previous amount of land. As this shows, it is the governments that can make a real difference.\n\nHowever, no matter how effective these steps could be, a lot more harm is likely to come in the wake of ceasing the meat production. One of the main problems deriving from halting the meat manufacturing could be a deteriorating economy that mostly benefits from the sales of meat products. This is in large part because, not only do these actions lead to a possible economic recession, but also cause ordinary people to suffer from a lack of meat consumption. For instance, Poland is one of many countries that get its cash flows through the export of meat products such as sausages and meat cans, so deprivation of their rights to sell those products would mean a stop in their thriving economy. Thus, attempts to reduce the meat production are likely to have adverse effects on the economy of a country.\n\nIn conclusion, although some steps could be taken towards tackling the issue of meat production, this might further lead to other more pressing matters that should be dealt with such as a potential loss of the main source of cash flows."},{"question":"Many animal species are becoming extinct as a result of human activities. What are the causes and possible solutions to this problem?","answer":"Human activities have undoubtedly impacted various sectors in the world. The extinction of a variety of animal species is not an exception. There are reasons such as unplanned urbanisation and hunting that are attributable to the extinction of wild lives. However, steps can definitely be taken to mitigate the problem.\n\nThe rapidly growing human population has caused cities to expand such that many a times they are unplanned. Inadequate planning causes more land to be used thus heralding more destruction of forests and cultivable lands. In addition, in many places around the globe, animals that are at the verge of extinction are hunted as their body parts are sold at very high prices. The rapid decline of snow leopards in the Himalayan regions of Nepal is mostly attributable to their poaching. Thus, it is evident that unplanned extension of cities and hunting of animals are to blame for their rapid decline in number.\n\nAs a solution to the problem, strict laws should be made and implemented in regards to planning of habitats and hunting of animals. Building of apartments that do not unnecessarily use and occupy spaces should be reinforced by the government. This will cause more efficient use of land thus declining deforestation to ultimately give more space for animals. Furthermore, poachers should be strictly punished and precious animal parts ought to be confiscated and destroyed. This will definitely cause a decline in the illegal hunting and reduce the extinction of animals.\n\nIn conclusion, human act of unplanned town planning and hunting are responsible for the extinction of many species of animals. However, with proper and effective plans and strict implementation of laws, the problems can be tackled."},{"question":"More and more wild animals are on the verge of extinction and others are on the endangered list. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?","answer":"It is true that there is a growing number of wild animals that are predicted to extinct in near future, and are on the list of endangered species. There are a variety of possible reasons for this, but steps can definitely be taken to tackle the problem. In my opinion, there are three major factors to blame for the rapid decline of wildlife. \n\nFirstly, the destruction of natural habitat has been a threat to the wild animals. The growth of global population has encroached the natural habit of wild faunae such that they do not have a suitable environment to thrive. Secondly, the food supply is scarce for wild animals. With global warming, a number of plant species have declined. This, in turn, has affected the ecosystem to the extent that many animal species \u2013 both herbivorous and carnivorous- to decline as well.\n\nLastly, the animals that manage to survive under all these adverse circumstances are hunted. Wild animals are poached for their skins, hoof and meat- most of which are believed to have aphrodisiac powers.\nThere are various steps that can be taken to mitigate the problem. Enough forests and natural habitat to the wild should be conserved so that wild animals can survive and live naturally. Also, the effect of wildlife and good effect they have on the environment should be educated to people by incorporating them in school syllabus and promoting television programmes, so that they work hand in hand for wildlife conservation. At the same time laws have to be made, and also strictly implemented against poaching, thus letting the remaining species survive.\n\nIn conclusion, there are various reasons why wildlife species are at the verge of extinction and there are solutions that when implemented can definitely help to address the problem."}]},{"title":"Discussion","content":[{"question":"Some people say that the best way to improve public health by increasing sports facility, others however say that they would have little affect on public health and other majors are required.\nDiscuss both views and give your own Opinion.","answer":"It is very common saying that ?Health is Wealth?. So, it is considered by many that best solution for public health is to increase facilities for sports. However, other believe that it only doesn?t play vital role in fitness, other things are also important to become healthy. In this essay I will discuss both views and try to reach a conclusion.\n\nBy increasing facilities for sports individuals who are keen interested in their health will take part in sports and will no longer be unhealthy. Since sports have its own joy people will rather take interest instead of being boring as usually in gymnasium. Therefore it will be quite easy for them to exercised by just playing any sports. In fact, as our university has announced sports week, students are paying attention to being part of this event, even though there are separate exercise rooms for all departments but most of them are often seem to be empty. \n\nHowever, few more things are equally important to being healthy. For instance, to take care of diet, avoid oily things, quit smoking, sleeping not less than 7 hours a day, and proper yoga. Furthermore, if someone tries to make himself\/herself healthy only sports will not do so, therefore it is mandatory to take these things under consideration. Moreover, few months back my friend Ali was suggested to take care of his health by doctor just because he is suffering from lungs cancer, since regardless of only playing any sport he should also avoid smoking even second hand smoking to live more.\n\nThe conclusion I have drawn is that both Sports and using proper guide, taking care of other things are important, sports is easy way to tend individuals towards their fitness rather than putting them in Gyms all the time, also taking care of few other things is key to become healthy we should take them parallel."},{"question":"Some people think that all universities student should study whatever they like. others believe, that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in future . such as , those related to science and technology. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Education is basic need, yet it is important for all to become educated whether it is of according to their choice or having science and technological subjects as majors . Both points will be analyzed before reach a conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, all pupils have their right to select their course which they want to pursue in future, because self interest will tend them to work hard. In addition, the field they are interested in will shape up their personality. Since, at university level they are not children any more although they have awareness of what actually is right or wrong for them as well as know how to survive in times of hardship.\n\nOn the other hand, science and technology both play a vital role in our daily lives. Both are increasing exponentially. Since, teaching plans made by university should not be considered as useless, because it is made by professionals under certain rules and regulation taking unemployment under consideration. For instant, in order to reduce unemployment ratio, most of Chinese Government third-level institutions are not allowing them option for elective. Moreover, This may also be helpful for those who have not decided their area of interest yet and are neutral.\n\nIn my opinion,both have their part to play however, latter one is far better than former one because these science and technological related subjects are standardized according to market under the supervision of higher commission which may open window of opportunities for them.\n\nIn conclusion, no doubt choosing subjects according to them selves has benefits, but perhaps key does lie with science and technology education under the umbrella of university standards."},{"question":"Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"It is believed by many that competitiveness among younger generations should be welcomed warmly. However, school of thoughts of other are totally opposite, who think that co-operation is far better than the competition in order to be a valuable person in future. Both points will be discussed in this essay before coming to a conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, having an ideology of to become on top position among all is useful in terms of life race because, this is the only way by which they can increase their confidence level. Lets take an example of the co-education system, every one is quite conscious about their results, even about their getup too. Similarly, a recent study in Human Behaviour in China revealed publicly that after creating co-education environment in primary schools, pupils started to compete with their opposite genders thus, approximately 42% average students increased their interest in their academics.\n\nOn the other hand, exchanging of ideas with other colleagues while studying plays important role in building up a personality and leadership skills. It has been said that Knowledge can only be increased by sharing and helping others in good manner. Cooperation with each other could make individuals innovative at the end too. For example, due to great failure ratio in Final Year Projects in almost all Higher Institutions in Pakistan, management has finally decided to make groups of maximum five students instead of making it alone to complete it by the deadlines, in results, failure ratio decreased by an unbelievable number of percentage (40).\n\nIn my opinion, there is no denying that both the competitiveness and the cooperation have their own advantages,but latter one is far better than former one,because it has endless benefits from study prospective to leadership qualities and also has long lasting effect in comparison to competitiveness which is for short term measure.\n\nIn conclusion, both competition and cooperation have their parts to play in making individuals a workable person , but , of-course key does lie with cooperation."},{"question":"It is generally believed that some people are born with certain talents, for instance for sports or music, and others are not.

Both the points will be discussed in this essay before coming to a conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, natural talent is considered to be enough requirement for any particular skill. None could beat them , if they have really found the skill in their selves. For instance, MirzaGhalib is famous Urdu poet till now, and it is to be said that he had not any teacher he got this art from, because, this particular skill of writing various types of unexpected couplets was actually gifted by God to him. Thus, no one at that time could be able to write such types of couplets who were doing it artificially.\n\nOn the other hand, working hard to get unpredictable success in any field is no doubt a workable solution. Thus, everyone is this world could be made successful in any field by giving them appropriate guidance which must be under guidance of any expert. For example, the world?s renowned football player Messi left no stone unturned in making himself almost perfect for the Football game, even though, he is considered to be one of those who bridged almost all gaps in order to be so.\n\nIn my opinion, both naturality in any particular skill and any skill taught perfectly have their parts to play in making anyone capable of doing it. However, personal interest is all above among them because, it is what which makes you able to showcase beauty of their talent.\n\nIn conclusion, God gifted artists, sportsmen or musicians and those who did their best in order to becoming so are undoubtedly at their desired levels , but, key does lie with personal interest and not doing it compulsively."},{"question":"Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country.

Many of the people argue that a foreign language study should be limited to travel or work purposes. While others claim that study languages have different reasons. Although limiting the language learning would help in decrease a load of study in schools, I believe that being bilingual would help the people exploring different cultures.\n\nOn the one hand, proponents of the first opinion think that removal of second language from school curricula would give more chance for other subjects. They presume that other languages could only be beneficial in case of travel either for tourism or for work. Germany is a prime example for the countries which do not support learning foreign languages in schools. However, I believe that second language would not increase the load of study in schools and have many other benefits.\n\nOn the other hand, supporters of teaching foreign languages for many other reasons hold the belief of different languages knowledge would help persons in various life aspects. As knowing different cultures and arts. Not to say that recently everyone should be able to use English to explore the internet which has huge sources of information. A recent survey conducted in the United Kingdom reveals that bilingual students have achieved better scores due to their use of the World Web Wide.

Now, in many countries especially in urban areas, the incidence of unlawful activities among young generation has increased. This essay will highlight the root causes of this pertinent problem and also will suggest remedies to tackle crime rate among youngsters in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nThe two main factors behind the rise in violation rate are illiteracy and unemployment. Education not only gives us academic knowledge but also helps us to understand about social norms, cultural values and responsibilities as citizen. Apart from it, unemployment leads to hopelessness, deprivation and it stimulate youth to indulge in unlawful activities. Take the United Nation report as an illustration, which state;?? an educated person who has a job is unlikely suggested to commit a crime. In simpler words, uneducated and jobless are prone to fall in unlawful activities. In addition, weak bond between parents and children is another reason of this. In cities usually both parents work, so they have very little time to spend with their children. Thus , it also act as one of the main contributing factor the rising rate of crime.\n\nComing towards remedial side, there is plethora of solutions available. In first place, Government should take radical measures to ensure education to the masses. An effective possible remedy is to create new job opportunities for youth. Proper implementation of law is another best solution. It is seen that usually in developing countries, governments fail to ensure proper law and order which results in increase rate of crime. Proper implementation of laws and strict law enforcing agencies could act as useful remedy. For instance, after introduction of Scotland yard in U.K , the crime rate plummeted. In simpler words, fear of punishment from law enforcing departments restrains youth even from thinking about the crime.\n\nTo conclude, there is no doubt in it that involvement of youth in illegal activities and delinquencies have become bane of society but it is not something to worry about. Responsibilities are on the shoulder of the government as well as on the parents. Parents should keep an eye on their children otherwise our new generation would become criminals"},{"question":"some people think that strict punishments for driving offences are the key to reduce traffic accidents ,other believe that there are other measurements could be more effective in improvement of road safety .\ndiscuss both view and give your opinion ?","answer":"There is a constant debate about eliminating Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) .some claim that legal penalties for inappropriate driving are substantial to minimize road accidents . Whilst, others advocate the view that safety enhancements of roads should be applied to overcome this issue. This essay will analyze both view of the argument , provided with my opinion accordingly.\n\nTo begin with , it is undeniable that implementing legal punishments for offensive driving habits is crucial .People obey more to laws when the legislations are strictly conducted by authorities to those who tend to deviates. In particular, penalties to drivers which carried out as payments will insure that such acts will not be repeated in the future. Moreover, punishments may extend beyond paying for law infraction. for example, some countries consider crossing the red light is a crime committing. Therefore, individuals who admit similar offensive acts are accused for prison .\n\nNevertheless, it should not be forgotten that , there are other useful measure which could be designed for improving the road traffic to tackles this problem . Firstly , it is crucial for the government to allocate apart of its annual budget to enhance the infrastructure and to make it more safe by designing special program system that can manipulate sever road congestion via computers and control room . therefore, traffic could be relieved and the accelerated with less accident rate . Similarly , highways should not left unwatched by cameras that could capture drivers with high speed.\n\nIn my perspective view, I strongly admire the fact that law should be applied on those who rely to deviate away from following the rules of driving. The result of irresponsible acts would lead to death, perhaps ,permanent disabilities. Therefore, offensive driving behaviors should be seriously penalized.\n\nThus even though, while some believe that legislations should be implemented on those who prpose to break the poper driving rules, other subscribed to the notion that, there are other solution to minimize RTAs . I claim that taking the responsibility while driving is vital , otherwise, penalties are essential for offended drive ."},{"question":"Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities.others however say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.\nDiscuss both views and gives your own opinion.","answer":"In this day and age,everyone is finding possible ways to live healthy.Few people claim that,it is necessary to have extensive sports facilities to enhance the life of the public,whilst other people opposing this saying,some other initiatives has to putforth to upgrade the people?s health.This essay agrees that maximising the number of sports training facilities will help in developing public health.This essay discuss both the views.\n\nIt is quite evident that,establishing plenty of sports facilities camps will eventually have a great impact in one?s health.Firstly,it helps the public to utilize the recreational facilities as much as possible.Moreover ,easy accessibility to these training academy really facilitates the professional athletes and others who wants to stay physically and mentally healthy. For instance: In developing countries like india,number of recreational facility centres are blooming in order to serve the public.Therefore as a result massive amount of people are benifited by the services rendered by these centres.\n\nHowever,there are other people stongly disagreeing claiming that some alternative steps could be taken in upgrading the health of the public.Thestatuatory body has to undertake the privatised recreational centres to their domain.But,this is an uphill task for the government to have a such kind of transition.Forexample:Handling the recreational centres without proper funding and maintainance will leave the people despair who are aiming to lead a healthy life.\n\nIn conclusion,while there are more benefits are on the way in boosting the public health ,increasing the sports facilities centres are far more better idea than taking other primitive measurements in the wellness of the people."},{"question":"The government spends about 220 million pounds a year supporting museums and galleries in the UK, and a similar amount subsidising the visual and performing art. This is a huge sum to spend on minority interest, and the money would be better spent on more important things. It should be up to people who enjoy cultural attractions to pay for them. What are your views?","answer":"Art facilities all over the world have been considered as a worthy way to invest substantial shares of money. The amounts spent on these arts in some countries equal those spent on education or health services. Some people argue that governmental funding should be limited with the essential life aspects rather than those visual amusements, which should be funded by people who may be concerned with them. However, in my opinion, countries governments need to continue supporting their art industry as a necessity and not a supernumerary.\n\nArts are one way of preserving the identity of the countries and the people generating them; Therefore, supporting those arts helps conveying and maintaining the civilizations. Until these days, ancient Egyptians, for example, are known as their art relics still stand for thousands of years. That means that, after a while, when our countries may not still exist, art vistage will be an important factor that indicates our presence at some point of the history.\n\nAnother thing suggesting that government need to continue supporting arts is that these aspects of life need to be available for people in all ages and financial states. By governmental funding for art exhibitions and museums, it does not form a burden to enjoy the beauty of art. Most school trips to museums are facilitated by government and made with no fees. Those trips are a good example of the importance of governmental support, without which they could not be made.\n\nIn short, Arts, which are being shaped of who we are, are an essential part of every countrys civilization. Thus, it is governments responsibility to finance those arts and to preserve and improve this important cultural aspect."},{"question":"Some people believe that a country museums should always be free for people to visit whatever the visitors age, income or nationality. Others disagree with this notion. Discuss these given ideas before reaching a conclusion\n","answer":"Generally, museum is a place where a particular nation\u2019s cultural identity is presented. In recent years, however, there has been a constant debate on whether entrance to the museums should invariably be free for people visiting there regardless of their income, age or nationality or should visitors still pay for it. There are arguments on both sides, however, which we will discuss here.\n\nOn the one hand, it might be said that if museums are free to visit for all people irrespective of their social status, age or nationality, the number of visitors will upsurge dramatically. As a result, people will start to take a large interest in the culture and history of a country by visiting museums be it a national or international museum. And this will lead to a great improvement in people\u2019s knowledge of history, culture and ethnics. Furthermore, it can surely be said that people can look at the unique artefacts or historical paintings to understand their mysteriousness. As it is not secret, there are some hugely popular paintings which require long hours to be fathomed. Finally, family members can create a strong bounding by exploring museums for free which otherwise could be ridiculously expensive for an extended family.\n\nConversely, the problem with allowed free entrance to museums is that the safety of artefacts will be under question as more people go to museums, it might affect the atmosphere of the artefacts negatively and even they might be damaged by hordes of people who are not aware of the rules of museums. For example, British museums have found that the stone of \u201cRosetta\u201d is being affected by the light of cameras as visitors capture its photo. It might also be said that, national economy of a country will suffer, if this system is going to be implemented. As it is by no means clear that money taken from visitors is used for restoration of artefacts and the museum itself and thus it will be on the shoulders of the government to provide museum with the amount of money.\n\nOverall, it appears that, while visitors benefit from this newly emerging trend it is obvious that it will be more of a burden for government. Implementing this system is hugely beneficial for improving public people's knowledge about history and culture."},{"question":"In a number of countries, some people think it is necessary to spend large sums of money on constructing new railway lines for very fast trains between cities. Others believe the money should be spent on improving existing public transport\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"Some people believe that there should be very fast trains available between different cities for travelling therefore it is very important to spend large amount of money on constructing new railway lines. Whereas, other people think that improving current public transport services should be the priority. In this essay, I will discuss both of these opposing views in detail for the better understanding of both asserted statements coupled with clear examples to reach a reasonable conclusion.\n\nThe first view is about constructing new railway lines for the very fast trains between cities. Nowadays, most of the people prefer travelling through trains due to several reasons. Some of those reasons are that travelling through trains is easy and comfortable, it takes less time to reach destination and also there is no traffic problem while travelling through trains. Due to these advantages people prefer railways construction because improving existing public transport will not be more helpful as usually public transport is owned by private people and they don\u2019t move the transport until there are enough customers whereas trains are always on time.\n\nOn the other side, spending all the money on constructing railways is not considered a good option for some people. They believe that the money should be spent in order to improve public transport that is already available. Trains can not be there every time, for example if a person books a train or miss a train he has to wait for long hours for the train to arrive whereas public transport is always available whenever we want. For travelling in some emergency public transport is considered a priority. This is why people want more money to be spent on improving public transportation.\n\nIn the end, I personally think that public transportation system is more reliable and it is always easily available where as travelling through trains requires booking seats and other formalities. Even though, travelling in a train is more comfortable but public transport is always readily available."},{"question":"Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal.Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Economic development is considered as the chief aim for authorities all over the world.Although,not everyone agrees with this idea,some say that there are other forms of progress which could be as significant as economic progress.Personally,I agree with the former idea on account of the lack of resources available to governments worldwide, forcing them to choose economic progress.\n\nIdeally, a government should pursue several,different types of progress ,for instance spiritual and intellectual progress.First of all,spirituality ,including religion, could provide a purpose to lives of many.For example,a study in Japan yielded remarkable result.Lack of spirituality was one of the most crucial elements for people committing suicide, according to the scientists. Similarly, universities and colleges promoting intellectual growth instill harmony and and tolerance ,among other positive qualities, and, hence, allow different societies to thrive in each others presence.Therefore, spiritual and intellectual advancement could contribute greatly to a nations well being.\n\nHowever, globally,most of the governments are not capable of dedicating equal resources to different forms of progress. Excluding a few countries,the majority of the government are financially weak.They would be ill-advised to pursue spiritual and intellectual progress with the same vigor as economic progress,since economic development would elevate a major portion of their population out of poverty. For these people lacking basic necessities, their governments must prioritise economic progress above all else. \n\nTo conclude, spiritual and intellectual progress may be beneficial for the society,but economic development is essential for the prosperity of all segments of the country's population and ,subsequently must be the chief goal of every government."},{"question":"Some people think that all University students should study whatever they like, other believe that they should only be allowed to study subject that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.","answer":"Since time immemorial choice of subjects to be learned by students is a hot potato topic. \nAccording to few populace, student should have freedom of choice regarding subjects they wanted to learn. On the contrary, other populace have Pessimistic view. support that there should be fixed syllabus, which will aid them in future. Hence, They insist of teaching syllabus engulfed by subjects on scientific research and technological advancement. Both views are elaborated in below essay and I opine the former review.\n\nAccording to few hoardes students must study the subject which they are interest because if learner are forced to learn they will not excel in their deeds. Additionally, learning half heartedly will be not fruitful because it is solid that half knowledge is always dangerous. If they are permitted to opt the course they are liking, There is probable chances to come out of flying colours. not only happiness which is now days locking in youngsters.\n\nMoreover, as per my opinion every individual has its own choice and therefore students should have liberty to study the course they wanted study. Firstly if they face failure they will not blame others. For their Downfall. Secondly, they will blame more responsible and will work hand to prove their decision to be right.\n\nLooking to flip side, some horeds support the thought to have listed syllabus, which they think will boost their careers. Because they think students have not faced the real world and they have no idea about market demand. Even more they consider that due to modernisation and globalisation teaching subjects like science and technology will help them to run in the race to fetch white collar job.\n\nFinally, I pen down by saying through concern of certain mass of society regarding career of there child is valid. Although, I think that each individual should have freedom of choice, no wonder child may take wrong decision, but parent should guide them and try to find what is better option for their child, instead of imposing one's choice on them."},{"question":"some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and academic world. Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Every moment world is achieving newer informations on countless fields like science commerce, education or so on. Admittedly, all the recent improvements are established on the basis of older theories and documents. Therefore, sharing updated versions can open wide range of opportunities to the upcoming generation. On the contrary, couples of knowledges are developed to be protected for the sake of mankind as well. Aftermath of discussions on both sides my stance will be clear.\n\nInevitably, this world is advancing following the footprints of earlier studies. If Newton would not have discovered his historical law of force, modern scientists might not think about sending spaceships to the space even. As business tycoons like Bill Gates have shared their struggle in life, young entrepreneurs don't loose their hope even after facing failures in their own fields. World managed to defeat epidemics of newer viral strands only because technology helped spreading the remedies across the vulnerable countries. Such examples always encourage us interchanging knowledges relentlessly.\n\nAlthough, exchanging information has been proved worthy in different fields, one group of people believes some materials should be kept classified. For instance, Apple is undisputedly an unique and successful company all over the world who keeps its authentic designs protected to maintain their standard. In case of education, countless courses are available nowadays to study in, but all of them are not enclosed to every student because relevant grooming up is required to learn specific subjects. Unless that, it might cause serious threat to humanity even. If an inappropriately qualified person works for atomic energy plant, it can destroy one entire civilization. So , clearly, some information is better to be saved from being generalised.\n\nAfter discussing both the views, I would like to put myself in the flexible zone as it is clarified that there is no negotiations with the secrecy of some data and some are just opposite. Someone cannot draw a fine line in between. In regards to maintain world peace, one international policy should be adopted for data protection that will decide which is for sharing and which not."},{"question":"Some people believe there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime.Others,however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime,and the motivation for committing it ,should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.\ndiscuss both these views and give your opinion.","answer":"It is often thought that the punishment for any particular unlawful act should be the same for everyone regardless of any factors involved in the crime.Nevertheless,others argue that things ,such as the intention and circumstances ,cannot be ignored.The question, therefore, is whether these factors should be taken into consideration or courts should only take the crime into account when awarding punishments.\n\nClearly,the people who advocate fixed punishments are worried that the if the courts start to consider the motivation and circumstances behind the crime, then these susceptible and vulnerable factors could be taken advantage of by the shrewd lawyers of criminals. Consequently, the conviction rate will plummet and the number of murderers,rapists etc roaming the streets will increase.Thus,with the intention of locking up as many criminals as possible,fixed punishment should strictly awarded for the benefit of the society,according to these people.\n\nHowever,these people forget the fact that several crimes occur solely due to either unforgiving circumstances or harmless intention.The environment could force a law-abiding individual to act out of his character and commit a crime or he may simply do so unintentionally.For example, a victim trying to save himself from an attacker kills him in the process.Obviously,he cannot be given the same punishment as someone who carried out a premeditated murder.Therefore.disregarding the the concerning circumstances and motivation behind the crime would result in unfair punishments being awarded to countless people.\n\nTo sum up,the society could benefit by awarding fixed punishments ,but is it worth sacrificing the lives of several people who ended up unintentionally committing an unlawful act or due to the circumstances involved."},{"question":"Some believe that it is good for a country\u2019s culture to import films and TV programmes, while others think it is better for a country to have their own films and TV programmes.

The main reason behind this view is that international television programs are one of the best sources of keeping track of what is currently happening around the globe which could, otherwise, be unavailable in domestic channels. Take an example of BBC channel of the USA, which is aired 24 hours a day, enabling people of any country to access the very channel at their convenience to be aware of up-to-the-minute news, thus contributing to the cultural diversity into the bargain. Therefore, it makes sense to watch TV programs made overseas to explore more about the foreign cultures.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some plausible counters to this argument. Obviously, by producing local movies and TV programs, citizens of a country would be able to acquire knowledge about their own culture as many long-standing traditions could be vividly conveyed in cinemas and on the media. As this shows, it is the local media products that have been keeping the age-old traditions of different nations alive.\n\nFinally, there are some crucial, yet unnoticed factors. If a large number of foreign films were imported, this would run the risk of spoiling the cultural value. This is due chiefly to the mass of products in the foreign cinematography which may contain some offensive or violent scenes that could be somewhat incongruous for either culture or religion of local people. Thus, it is clear why many disapprove of foreign films, hence choosing domestic ones.\n\nIn conclusion, although both views provide valid reasons for their arguments, I firmly believe that it is better for people to have their national TV channels and films, which can improve people\u2019s cultural understanding and do not contain any displays of abuse."},{"question":"It is generally believed that some people are born with certain talents, for instance for sport or music, and other or not. However, it is sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or musician.\nDiscus both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"Talent is the inherent ability in a person for something.Some believe that certain humans have an inborn ability to do certain things, while others believe that man can achieve anything by will and hard work. Both these views would be analysed in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nIt is thought by some that people are born with a talent for some specific things and that it is not likely that anybody can be trained to match the kind of skill that a naturally-talented person possess. For instance, during school some children are good in studies while some other have a knack for sports. A lot of the time, the studious pupils don't do too well in outdoor sports and vice versa. Thus, it shows that some people may have an innate ability to do specific things.\n\nContrary to the above opinion, there are those who are of the mind that anybody can be trained to do anything. A good example of this are the musician families in the subcontinent. These families usually train their children from the go to pursue this field. These children, through hard work and practice, turn out to be great musicians themselves. So it may seem that people can be trained to do well in music and sports afterall.\n\nHaving discussed both views, I am of the opinion that people are born with talents for specific things. A person may do well in a certain field and not in others. Programs and tests should be employed to tap into his hidden potentials."},{"question":"Some people believe there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime and the motivation for committing it should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"It is believed by some that perpetrating criminal activity should be punished with a standardized punishment regardless of the type of a crime, while others are of opinion that it is important to consider conditions and reasons of a defendant to commit that certain offence. In this essay, both opposing views will be analyzed before providing my own opinion.\n\nFrom one viewpoint, were the same punishments for any law-breakers in a crime-related legislation, there would be a significant decline in crime rates. To put it another way, if any type of offence, even shoplifting was punished with sentencing to a long-term imprisonment, people would ultimately be afraid of committing even minor crimes not to mention serious violent offences, since nobody wants to waste his life away behind bars just for one wrong little action. In the long term, this change could work out to establish the peace in this world. Therefore, it might be said that the world could benefit from this fixed-punishment policy.\n\nFrom another angle, it is believed that jury should thoroughly investigate the crime and learn every detail of it before reaching their verdicts. This is because there are different situations in life, for example one can commit murder defending herself from a rapist, apparently in this case, punishments for this \u2018criminal\u2019 should be softened, as otherwise she herself could have been violated (or could have even died). Thus, an army of people thinks punishing any crime with the same punishments is a nonsense and for the sake of justice, extenuating circumstances of offenders should be taken into consideration.\n\nIn summary, both sides of the argument regarding punishing the criminals have strong support. However, after a careful analysis it is clear that the conditions of any crime should be considered in the first place before reaching a verdict, since sometimes the circumstances force even innocent people to commit a crime. Thus, for the sake of such \u2018criminals\u2019 and \u2018fairness\u2019 court should carry out a detailed investigation before punishing the individuals."},{"question":"Some people that it is good for a country\u2019s culture to import films and TV programmes, while others think it is better for a country to have their own films and TV programmes.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.","answer":"It is believed by some that it is beneficial for a country\u2019s culture to broadcast foreign movies and TV shows on local channels, while others are of opinion that it would be better to develop the cinematography industry and air national films and TV programmes. In this essay, both opposing views will be analyzed before providing my own viewpoint on this.\n\nFrom one standpoint, constant transmission of non-domestic TV shows or movies may help people explore other country\u2019s conventions, since those films or programmes tend to reflect vividly their lifestyles and time-honored traditions. This in turn would be beneficial for a country\u2019s culture, as long as having gained some insight into other lands\u2019 way of life, people could pick up new traditions and start to apply to their own countries, which would bring some diversity to the lives of the locals. Therefore, it might be said that importing foreign films and TV programmes could be a good idea.\n\nFrom another angle, countries would derive certain benefits if they broadcasted domestic movies and shows. In other words, national film products tend to embody the long-standing traditions and mores and above all, have a sense of national spirit. Airing these films and programs would evoke feelings of national pride and would make people value their cultures even more. Thus, it is clear why some believe that having domestic movies and TV shows is of a paramount importance.\n\nFinally, there are also some crucial but unnoticed factors. Exposure of people to non-domestic films and programmes can have negative ramifications. To put it another way, foreign movies (especially Western countries\u2019) sometimes tend to promote violation such as homicide, pornography, which in turn results negatively in youngsters\u2019 behavior; they are becoming cold, drug addicted and experimenting with sex at an ever-earlier age. This example speaks volume about how these non-national products could be dangerous for both culture and the society.\n\nTo conclude, I believe promoting domestic films and TV shows is more beneficial and \u2018secure\u2019 than foreign ones. Thus, it is hoped that countries all over the globe will develop their own film industries and broadcast national products."},{"question":"Some people think that the best way to gather information is through newspapers while others believe in other better ways. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","answer":"In today's world, nobody can lead their life smoothly without considering the importance of news and evidence in our day to day life.For this purpose, one school of thought believes that the print media such as newspapers, are the principle source and the perfect way to collect the details of various happenings, around the globe. However, others contradict this opinion and believe that various better options have arose, to keep people aware of news and casts, all around the world.\n\nFrom ancient civilization to modern world, print media has always been a famous tool to keep public aware of facts and figures. The development of print media, from a paper to the pages of newspaper, is the greatest achievement for newspaper lovers. For example, most of the elderly people still consider it a very convenient source of getting information. Moreover, they prefer to spare their time by sitting, relaxing and reading it, in order to kill their time, in a very efficient manner.\n\nHowever,if we look at other perspective, there are various means to stay updated, such as television, radio, social medias, messengers and applications like whatsapp. In this world of high standards and competition, majority of youngsters dont get time to invest their time on reading newspapers, so they prefer to stay knowledgeable by other smart ways. For example, they utilize their dead time while driving, by turning on their radios and surfing different websites for knowing the world affairs during their leisure hours. Hence, they organize themselves meticulously and at the same time with updated and certainly with vast knowledge.\n\nTherefore, not with standing the fact, that the impact of newspapers was the most popular source in the past. Having said that, i personally believe that in this modern era, more better ways are present to figure out the details of daily affairs."},{"question":"At the present time the population of some countries includes a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of old people. Do the situation outweigh the disadvantages. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"In recent years, world population is effected to a large extent where mortality ratio of young people have declined significantly this in turn caused the rise of adult population while the population of older people have relatively decreased compared to the past.\n\nYoungsters and adults are considered to be the spine of a nation. They are active and filled with enthusiasm when it comes to work for a country middle aged people are always preferred in every field because the amount of hard work they put in is always justified. For instance, civil services of my country have an age limit to appoint so they can train their officers without any hurdle. Moreover, adolescent are usually observed getting involved in welfare work and social campaigns which helps in prosperity of a nation.\n\nSome others contested that longevity of older people is a need of time where youth have forgotten their values and do not follow their peers. In this era if older people lives longer they can promote the culture and values to the next generations. For example due to the fast paced lifestyle of today's youth they don't interact with their elders this is the reason why many traditions are dying. In addition to this having our forefathers with us is a blessing we can ask for their expert advices because of the experience.\n\nIn my opinion increment in the ratio of adults have found to be more beneficial, because they help running the engine of a nation in a great manner by providing every effort needed."},{"question":"Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime.Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime,and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.\nDiscuss both these views and give your opinion.","answer":"Granting appropriate punishment to offenders, no matter the crime, ensures justice in a society.Some people argue that a standard punishment should be set for each offence. In contrast, others believe that each crime be dealt uniquely based on variable conditions of wrongdoer and reasons for committing a certain crime.This essay will analyze both sides of argument before reaching a conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, it is said that judicial system devise a standard set of penalties depending upon the nature of felony. This implies that severity of the wrongdoing will determine the duration and intensity of the sentence.For instance, In India, an intoxicated driver is charged with license suspension and monetary fine,whereas, a burglar will be penalized for 2 or more years in a prison. Thus, the more serious a crime, more severe are the legal consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, some say that in order to serve justice,it is imperative to take into account the rationale behind the unlawful act.To illustrate, a destitute and homeless individual may be forced to steal money to satisfy his basic needs.Such circumstances demand logical consideration by the law to ensure justice is served. Hence, certain sanctions maybe modified depending upon the nature of crime and conditions of the transgressor.\n\nTo conclude, it is pivotal that legal and judicial system of a state ensure fair and objective penalization in order for the society to function optimally.In this regard, I believe that the state of affairs of each offender be assessed independently before deciding the penalty for his misconduct rather than just having a standard set of punishments for various crimes."},{"question":"Some people work for the same organization all their working life. Others think it is better to work for different organizations. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"When a person joins a company, little does he knows whether he will work long-term with a company or he will switch the job for wider prospects outside. It is rather a perplexing situation. Both views have its advantages which will be analyzed below followed by my opinion and a reasoned conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, people who like to stick with a particular firm values job security and loyalty the most. This is because they feel a sense of belongingness towards their company and like to give everything to it. Also, when they work harder, their prospects of promotion increases and they jump the career ladder rather quickly which ultimately leads to better job satisfaction. Also , employers values their contribution and they are showered with incentives and perks such as lifelong pension and lump-sum gratuity when they retire.\n\nHowever, working with same company leads to monotonous life for employees and sometimes a person become disillusioned as well .His skills become obsolete and he will always dread to face challenges .He will not like to experiment and undertake any sort of risks and will perish in cut- throat completion .Hence moving from one job to another guarantees wider skills and person becomes better equipped with changes .His social network increases which ultimately boost his confidence as well. For instance, 2016 labor law study in India shows that employees who keep on switching their jobs are better equipped to face any economic crises like recession , as they can adjust themselves in any odd jobs.\n\nTo conclude, although there are many appealing reasons to remain with a particular job as it will benefit both the employer and the employees, but, In my opinion, it is more valuable to keep on experimenting with jobs as a person will gather a lot of information and skills and hence he will be better equipped to deal with any unforeseen critical situations in the long run."},{"question":"Some people believe that allowing children to make their own choices on everyday matters(such as food,clothes and entertainment)is likely to result in a society of individuals who only think about their own wishes.Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.","answer":"It is argued that children having freedom in everyday matters grow up to be selfish individuals while others believe that it is necessary that young ones have a say on issues that have a direct impact on their lives. this essay will discuss both these views before reaching a reasonable conclusion.\n\nSome say that if children are given the opportunity to make decisions in their daily lives,it will turn them into self centered members of the society. The core of the argument is that, if at such tender age, they start deciding for themselves what they want to do,eat or wear and play with, it would make them overlook their parents or guardians wishes. Because a child is not yet mentally mature enough to understand the possible impacts of his choices, he may put himself in danger by not listening to some one more experienced than him. Ultimately, having the choice to do whatever and however he wants, such a child would grow up to be a selfish person who only makes choices to please himself with no regards for anybody else. This is not a healthy attitude and such egocentric individuals will have a negative impact on the society they live in.\nFor instance,in most Western nations, young ones have relatively greater freedom to make choices in their everyday tasks as compared to Asian children. This has cultivated a self obsessed attitude in children of the former countries leading to a dysfunctional and self absorbed society.\n\nOthers, however, stipulate that it is important to allow children to have a say regarding matters that affect them directly. This is vital as it not only leads to their intellectual development but also makes them self reliant and builds confidence. A current study in United States revealed that children who were given freedom to make decisions for themselves in various daily activities performed 62% better at group projects at school. This led the researchers to conclude that these children had better communication skills and were more confident and decisive.\n\nTo conclude, i firmly believe that it is crucial that young children be allowed to make decisions on matters concerning them to a certain extent in order to build their confidence and independence. However, guardian supervision is necessary to prevent them from completely becoming self serving individuals as they grow up."},{"question":"Some people think that the teenage years are the happiest of our lives, while others believe that adult life brings more happines.\nDiscuss both these views and give your opinion.","answer":"Life is very precious and its span is short. For many, living in teen is the most favourable part, while some opine that life is more joyful when we become mature. Let us examine both aspects and final opinion will be drawn in a conclusion.\n\nEvery stage of life has its own perks and charms, like youngsters enjoy their lives as they have no responsibilities and can follow varoius hobbies during luxurious time. They can hangout with acquaintances for longer hours as compared to a person who has a job and specific timings for work and other activities. Similarly, little champs have tension free life as no pressure of guarding anyone. Unfortunately in this duration, youths have limited resources and are under their parents, therefore this prohibits their freedom. For instance, I personally know an upcoming music band of college students, they used to have alot of fun together and spend most of time in musical activities, but due to less support from parents, they had to dismiss their passion.\n\nHaving a suitable profession gives more satisfaction to a person and this favour comes to life with aging. An individual is energetic and enthusiastic at this stage of life. They had achieved their proper career, at handsome salary status and are blessed with family life. Achieving all those milestones provide relaxation to metal levels. An ideal example is of a sucessful enterpreneur, living with spouse and children who can purchase any item of his\/her need and cherish life to any extent.\n\nTo sum up, as far as I am concern, my opinion goes with the life of rippen age, where delight and welfare is worthy. However, adolescent is a time when one can afford carelessness."},{"question":"Many governments think economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.","answer":"There are different views about what should be the utmost priority of government to paves the way of development. While it is argued that financial advancement is crucial to consider; nonetheless, insignificant number of people contend this notion and think that other aspects are equally imperative in the essence of significance. Both arguments will be discussed following a rational conclusion including my opinion.\n\nGenerally, it is paramount to set economic development as a principle for progression of a country. This is because it will enhance job prospects and thus a country will curb poverty. As government will invest more money to domestic industry like agriculture and garments factory, not only will it encourage local entrepreneurs but also international or multinational companies to spend in that country\u2019s economy, which in turn will create more avenues of work for its inhabitants that ultimately boost the succesful buildup of other sectors by spending the additional revenues. Thus,it is evident why government ought to focus on economy.\n\nHaving said that, it is also incumbent for a nation to contemplate in other progress indicators is thought by some people. Since all aspects are inextricably linked to each other, it is pressing matter for a state to target it\u2019s infrastructure like education, communication and security if they intend to provide a world class quality of living, which defines country\u2019s extension of development. If a country ensures better education and accessible communication , it will yield more skilled workforce who might get more time to assist in building an comprehensive economy instead of being stagnant in traffic congestion.\n\nTo conclude, although it seems momentous to focus on solely economic enforcement ,which is integral part of nation's finance, I believe that other aspects like standard education and improved communication system will amplify development in total because one sector is not mutually exclusive of others."},{"question":"Some people believe that anyone can create art such as painting, poetry, music and so on. Others think that a person should have special abilities to create art.\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"It is often argued that any individual can paint, write rhyme and play music, whilst others contend that artists should have special skills to perform and present art. I am inclined to believe that a person should have aptitude and certain competence of arts. Nevertheless, both sides will be analyzed in the succeeding paragraphs of this essay to justify my inclination on the second premise and disagreement on the first statement, followed by a conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, an art is considered as a non-technical field, and any person can paints a canvas, compose a poem and plays music. This is because of the fact that arts have no relation with academics, and no expertise is required to perform a piece of amateur art. For example, I am an engineer and as a leisure activity I plays guitar; however, with some practice at home and video tutorials from You Tube helped me a lot to become a good guitarist. Considering my own example it is clear that anyone can perform well. Thus, it is also clear that a little amount of coaching can teach intermediate level of arts but good professional artists are born with special capability that is why they give master piece in their performance.\n\nConversely, some people opine that a best performance is only possible, if a person has competent understanding about fine arts, poetic rhymes and melody. To be more precise, a professional artist is a born artist and the unique talent is the pre-requisite of outstanding performance in aforementioned fields of arts. Take Michael Jackson and Picasso as instances of this argument. These artists know well how to present perfectly in front of their audience and exhibition attendees. This also shows that talented people with exceptional skills are able to present their master piece for their viewers. Therefore, it is now understandable that why a person with capable levels of their trade can perform excellently.\n\nIn conclusion, after viewing that anyone can perform well in arts and only expert skills are needed to produce arts, I support second statement strongly because artist should have specific skills of his trade to present splendidly for his audience."},{"question":"Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion","answer":"Some countries may argue that financial growth is their primary target, whereas others believe that progress in other sectors ought to be given equal importance as well. I would argue that progress in the form of higher literacy rate of a nation is as important as economic development.However, this essay will discuss both points of view.\n\nFinancial stability is the reason why most nations focus all of their resources on economic progression. Being stable in terms of the economy will ensure the country is self-sufficient and not dependent on other countries or organizations for loans in order to sustain a better standard of living for their citizens. For instance, Pakistan takes loans of about 10 billion dollars yearly from the World Bank because their economy is not strong enough. If there was a strong focus on the economy the country would not take this exorbitant amount of loans and burden the present and upcoming generations with debts.\n\nIn spite of the above arguments, others, including me, support the view that if the governments pay as much attention to the educational sector, as to the economy, it will yield long-term benefits. As illiteracy is the root cause of all social evils. By allocating budgets and focusing resources on education, it would result in a more prosperous country as it would curb unemployment, crime rate and would bring with it more investment opportunities as more more people would be willing to invest in a peaceful country . Sweden is a prime example, where the literacy rate is 96 percent, and it has the lowest unemployment, crime rates and is the most favored destination for immigration purposes because of a better quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, some people may view growth in the form of the economy as the number one goal for the development of a country, but I strongly believe in order to be a successful country one has to spend money on schools, colleges, and universities as it will prove beneficial in the long run."},{"question":"Computers are being used more and more in education.Discuss the advantages and the disadvantages and give your own opinion.","answer":"In the modern world, computer technology has become a fundamental component of education, and its use can be easily seen in almost every classroom around the world.Undoubtedly, computers have a lot of advantages such as easy access to information and portability, but they also have few disadvantages like users will become more dependent on them and less interaction with their peers and teachers.This essay will discuss both aspects.\n\nTo begin with, owing to their user-friendly properties, easy access to a wealth of information and easy to carry and lightweight has made computers the best educational gadget amongst both the teachers and students.Additionally, students can attend the live lectures outside the classroom online.They can present their work in the classroom in a better way than which was used in the past for instance use of handmade slides.The students can also submit their projects online using computers.\n\nOn the other hand, besides plenty of benefits of using computers, they cannot replace the real-life experience of learning, for example, they cannot replace the role of teacher. Experts have shown that those students who are dependent on computers for their education may do well in their studies, but they have serious problems of communication and interpersonal skills which are required for career progression. Furthermore, excess working on computers is related to specific medical illness like wrist pain, backaches, and vision problems.\n\nTo conclude, although computes play significant role in the education system, but I believe that they cannot replace the traditional classrooms"},{"question":"Should children be taught about the use of recycle materials and to avoid the wastage at school or homes. discuss both views and give you opinion.","answer":"The concept of reusing materials started in the nineteenth century. It is defined as either refine a material or alter its physical state into another form, to consume it again. The significance of learning children regarding recycling and avoiding waste will be detailed in this essay.\n\nTo begin with, perhaps a significant reason why children should be taught about recycling is that, they can utilise the left-over products again. At the same time, it would help the world become cleaner. It can be done by introducing basics of recycling through their input. For example, teachers can ask students to bring plastic and glass bottles and show them in recycling plants how they are processed into plastic bags and decoration pieces.\n\nNevertheless, children learning about utilizing wastage at schools and homes would provide them with a better understanding as a responsible citizen as well as to realise the importance to maintain the ecosystem, less pollutant. For instance, leftover food and drinks can be biodegraded into plant nutritional contents for the use of plants and trees. Likewise, introduce the importance of not wasting food and water, so that not only it can be reserved for the needy but also less waste is likely to be piled up.\nAccording to my opinion, I believe, children should be exposed to the process of conserving stuff and maintain a healthy relationship with their environment.\n\nIn conclusion, learning about reusing and producing less waste is not an overnight process. It requires persistent efforts to instil the importance of the above mentioned statement. It is recommended that schools ought to develop programs and arrange trips to the recycle plants to promote this phenomenon."},{"question":"Some people think that politicians have greater influence in the society, others think that scientist have greater influence. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Since the origin of mankind, people of various fields have a different impact on the society. A school of thought holds an opinion that politicians have deep ramifications on the society; while the opponents of this view declare that scientist have greater influence. Both the views will be discussed followed by my personal opinion on this on hand topic.\n\nThe proponents of first view state that society is significantly affected by the policies of government about human development and infrastructure. As, these policies are formulated and made by politicians, so they have the direct influence on the society. This, in turn, means that an excellent policy will benefit the community and vice versa. For instance, it was because of the labor and industrial policies of Mou Zu Tang in 1949, that China has now become an economic power. In simpler words, government policies have a direct influence on the society.\n\nOn the other hand, the opponents of the first perspective contend and consider that scientists have the significant impact on the society because the lifestyle of the people has revolutionized in the past few decades due to the inventions of scientists. To illustrate it, take the invention of penicillin, that has dramatically reduce the mortality rate related to infection. In addition, the world has transformed into a global village because of the invention of mobile phones. On the basis of these arguments, it seems that scientists have a profound impact on society.\n\nTo conclude, although scientists have a considerable influence on the society, I am of the view that politicians have more influence since it is the decision of the politician to decide about how much funds and facilities should be provided to scientists for research purpose. Without financial and political support, scientist alone cannot do anything. Therefore, the aforementioned arguments clearly strengthen my view that politicians have a greater influence than scientists on the society."},{"question":"Human activity has had a negative impact on the plants and animals around the world. some people think that its too late to do anything, while others believe actions can be taken to improve the situation. discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Flora and fauna are one the essential tiers of the ecosystem; however, human-based activities brought perils to the animals and plants around the globe. Some believe it is useless to take preventive measures, while others think some steps can be taken to combat with the menaces.\n\nOn the one hand, the constant processes of logging and hunting down the animals are being taken place in the majority of the countries. That is to say; people are using forest-wood for construction and making space for the growing population. At the same time, animals skin is being used in costumes and accessories. Both the purposes are fulfilling the requirements of the humans; therefore, individuals are reluctant to amend the situation. For example, mass deforestation and animal extinction have been seen in Africa as a result of their utilisation in processes mentioned above.\n\nOn the other hand, some proponents set forth some propounds to combat the issues above, including recycling and levy a tariff. In other words, the alternative to deforestation is recycling, which would help in utilising the used wood materials again. In this way, less logging would be required to utilise in constructions. For example, in China, companies recycle wood with other materials to use it to a great extent, and as a result, deforestation is declined up to 45percent. Similarly, imposing a tax can help to refrain companies consuming animal goods for their use. It would force them to substitute animal goods to other materials like plastic, which is now taking place in many brand companies.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe in efficient solutions pertinent to the natural habitat. In this way, we can make a reservation for the future and cope with the aftermaths effects of losing animals and plants to a broader extent."},{"question":"Some people say children should play games that require teamwork such as football and basketball whereas, some think they should be doing individual sports such as swimming and running\ndiscuss both views and give your opnion.","answer":"Sports have great significance for children. A school of thought holds an opinion that children should involve in games that demand group efforts, while the opponents are of the view that games played in isolation are better. In this essay I shall discuss both the views followed by my personal view on this pertinent issue.\n\nThe proponents emphasize children to indulge in sports that require teamwork, because it will enable them to learn values like discipline, goal setting, and how to work in a team. This in turn, would help them in their future life. Another essential aspect is a sense of cooperation, a trait that is the precursor of to success. For instance , I was a member of my school basket ball team, the habit that I had assimilated as a team member helped me to adjust myself with my office colleagues. As, almost in all work place , people have to perform duties in form of groups , so it is obvious that how important it is for the children to learn these essential values in their childhood by playing sports like football and basketball.\n\nOn the other hand , the opponents consider sports and recreational activity , meant for fitness , that is why they cite that children ought to involve in individual games like cycling, running, and swimming. Since, games like football evoke the feelings of competition which is a negative feeling, therefore what children should do is to stay away from grouped sports and play games in isolation. On the basis of the above mentioned argument it is clear that why people are in favor of playing games in isolation.\n\nTo conclude, although sports are meant for fitness and enjoyment , I am of the view that there are enormous benefits of playing games ,like football and basket ball ,owing to the fact that working team will instill vital traits in children , that will help them to reshape themselves as competent professionals. In addition , these value would never be acquired in isolation."},{"question":"Some people think that professional athletes make good role models for young people, while others believe they don\u2019t.\nDiscuss both these points of views and give your own opinion.","answer":"Undoubtedly, skilled sportsmen are widely well known. Although a group of people sees that they are a good idol for youth, others contend that they are not. From my perspective, I cannot align myself with either opinion, because I have some reservations about both of them.\n\nOn the one hand, famous athletes can be perfect examples of achieving goals by hard work and stubbornness. Since successful players, as published in the media, stick to schedules of continuous training and work on their skills, they finally become champions with a worldwide fame. Subsequently, we can use their success stories as a motive to and teenagers and youth to do their best to be idols. Some research studies proved that this kind of aforementioned motivation has been always an effective way to bring out significant result while educating students. Thus, if we can depend on brilliant sportsmen as role models, youth will probably be triggered to accomplish their future targets.\n\nOn the other hand, some viewpoints may guess that the luxurious lifestyle of these popular icons might be a sort of lavishness and exaggeration. So, it can be disappointing to many young people to see such form of incredible wealthy life. For instance, when the footballer Cristiano Ronaldo appears in the media enjoying his weekend on a luxurious yacht, we can feel that he only plays football games for fun, which do not deserve this large sum of money. Many individuals who suffer from financial problems and can barely live are likely to hate such players. Therefore, the lifestyle of popular athletes can be disappointing rather than being a motive to the younger generations.\n\nTo conclude, after pondering upon both viewpoints, it is felt that despite the fact that success journeys of famous sportsmen can be an efficient instance to motivate youth, their extra-wealthy life may adversely affects those who struggle with hard living conditions. Thus, it is better not to focus on the personal lives of public sports figures."},{"question":"Some people think that travel is necessary to learn about other nations. Others however think tv and internet are best way to learn about other countries.\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion","answer":"Travelling is an essential part of our lives. A few people believe that travel is important in order to explore other countries. However, others think television and the internet are better modes to learn about different countries. This essay will elucidate both views in succeeding paragraphs, followed by opinionated conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, understanding culture and tradition of other nations by travel is of its own significance. It is to say that when people travel to various places, they not only could better understand the customs of these places, but the information they percieve is genuine. Finland is a prime example, where tours are based according to their history book to omit any kind of false description during the tour. As a result, tourism is most popular in respective country as tourists calibrate more by respecting their social and cultural norms.\n\nOn the other hand, the internet and television are one of today's advanced technologies, which people are relying upon. Any kind of information can be subscribed by pressing a single button, without any inconvenience of time. Therefore, a number of people use them for instant news, but the authenticity of information getting on such mediums are not guaranteed. For instance, the internet review on country formation of Pakistan is recently updated as it has wrongly showed history of Bangladesh as Pakistan, even some got offended. Thus, the differnce between authenticity in first hand information and knowledge from other sources remains their.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, Live experience of learning is more essential to be informed of other people cultures, than the uploaded or broadcasted information."},{"question":"Some countries today have passed laws against smoking tobacco in public buildings such as of ices and restaurants. Other countries have no intention of doing this.\nConsider the possible arguments on both sides of this debate, and reach your own conclusion on which side you favour.","answer":"Nowadays, a number of countries have recently outlawed smoking in public places such as parks and working buildings for the welfare of the community.However, some countries seem to have no implementation for addressing this issue.In this essay, I will discuss about this debate from both sides and draw my own conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, some poor countries have to struggle with financial problems especially to provide infrastructure for the public in particular.In this case, it might be said that as a government, there would be less emphasis on legislation concerning health care management system when it comes to the problems of smoking.Another widely-observed factor is that other countries have no school curriculum for health education particularly at primary education level.As a result, children appear to have no knowledge for healthy habits and start trying to smoke in their early ages and must be difficult to control smoking when they grow old, and there would be some challengings for the authorities to impose rule of law on such populace.\n\nOn the other hand, law enforcement has been carried out effectively by many countries ,for instance, the UK in light of banning smoking in crowded areas for the interests of the public.In those countries,there seem to have wide range of media coverage for health educations with regard to health benefits of non-smoking and complications of smokings such as respiratory tract diseases ,for example, lung cancer and exacerbation of other non communicable diseases like heart disease ,hypertension and dibetes ,and meaning that from children to older generation , they can have a proper knowledge of negative consequences of smoking.Finally, it would be easy for the government to enforce laws on such people.\n\nOverall, it is logical to conclude that prevention of smoking tobaccos or cigarettes by the government would create a country to become much healthier and more prosperous ,and there must be substantial drawbacks for those countries which do not prohibit smoking in public."},{"question":"Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities study tighter. Discus both these views and give your opinion.","answer":"Schools are doing their best to impart knowledge to students and for this, streaming students according to their academic abilities is a new trend. Some people favor this move, however, for others this unwelcome .Both these views will be critiqued below followed by a conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, mixed classes helps to build better learning environments for students. This is because they can learn from each other, there will be healthy competition among learners to match their peer\u2019s academic result , consequently leading to better performance. For instance , a gifted student in art but week in science, can learn from others and vice versa, thereby creating cording relations with each others.\n\nOn the other side, segregating students on the basis of abilities can help teachers tailor made lessons according to learning ability of the kids,. In this way, they can learn better and cope up with study pressure .Also there will be less time wastage a teachers can follow same methodologies for a particular stream, rather than making different lessons for a different skill kids in a same class.\n\nIn my opinion , dividing kids according to their learning skills have some hidden pitfalls as will bring inferiority complex in them and they will feel dejected and less motivate leading to low confidence . For instance, in many schools, there are A, B,C,D grades and students belonging to D section are always looked down upon.\n\nTo sum up , mixed ability schools should be preferred above grading as it will bring healthy competition among kids and even weaker student will put all efforts to match the best in class and hence can surpass his\/her capabilities."},{"question":"Some people believe that politicians have greatest influence on the world, while some believe that scientists have greatest influence on the world. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Influential personalities always try to contribute, in a positive manner, for the betterment of society. One side of doctrine states that the politicians serve more influence as they run the countries; whereas, others believe the scientists through their inventions and advancements produce more impact on the world.\n\nOn the one hand, perhaps one of the crucial role politicians play is the upbringing and development of a country. That is to say; they are one of the main tiers of politics, which help the country to economically and financially grow. At the same time, they make sure to take essential measures for the sovereignty of the country. Therefore, people mark them as an admirable source to tackle with their work politics and home economics. For example, different levels of diplomatic relations among politicians over the world are being taught at many working organisations to set an explanation of how to deal diplomatically. However, the exposure of influence is only confined to inter-relation and economics.\n\nOn the other hand, scientists are considered as source inspiration due to their higher intellect and IQ level. In other words, by the help of discoveries and inventions at various fields, they hold a stronger influence on the people of the world. For instance, inventor of Microsoft software is regarded as a role model for the career-oriented individuals. Moreover, because of their inventions from basic home devices to industries, their contribution along with its influence is more remarkable.\n\nIn conclusion, although people appreciate politicians in the fields of economic and diplomatic relations, the various developments done by scientists make them more impersonated by the people."},{"question":"Some people say that the best way to improve health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"It is considered that increase in sports amenities would bring betterment in public health. The opponents argue that other alternatives should opt because sports have minimum impact on human health. This essay will outline both arguments, and then conclusion will be drawn.\n\nIn most parts of the world, people are suffering from health-related issues such as diabetes, cardiac issues and obesity. The main reason is that they are not provided with recreation centers and sports facilities. If the state builds modern sports stadiums with gyms, cricket and football grounds in every big and small city, it will give an opportunity to their residence to adopt active lifestyle. For instance, Imran Khan, renown cricketer in his 60s living healthy and fit life without any co-morbidities. This example proves that living active lifestyle improve health condition.\n\nOn the other hand, opponent argues that other alternatives should be encouraged. First, delicious fast food should be cut down from everyday life. According to medical journals, these scrumptious food contain rich amount of cholesterol and lipids, these are leading agents for triple vessel disease and diabetes. Secondly, it is adviced that people should do their physical check-up at least once in three months. The regular check-up may enhance the chance to pick a disease at an early stage.\n\nTo sum up, it is clear from above arguments that out-door activities are beneficial for a healthy lifestyle. It seems to me that sports stadiums should be made for the well being of public health, but other alternatives cannot be overlooked."},{"question":"some people think that space exploration is a waste of resources while others think that it is essential for mankind to continue to explore the universe in which we live \nDiscuss both view and give your opinion ?","answer":"With the evolution in technology , it is easier to explore the space and planets in 21st century. There is a controversial argument going on nowadays that, some people believes that doing research about the universe is a waste of time and investment . However, others believe that , it is fruitful always to know about the universe for the survival of mankind. In this essay ,both point of views will be discussed along with my opinion on the matter.\n\nSpace exploration is necessary to enhance the lifestyle of individuals. Scientists and engineers are working immensely hard to learn about the life in planets in the galaxy ,to fulfill the needs which are depleting in the world . For instance , after research of many years ,scientists have come acrossed with myriads of benefits for human life . One major discovery out of the research was of water around earth ,which have been utilized for various purposes like , generating electricity and others . Thus , it is apparent from the above example that exploring about the space is beneficial for mankind.\n\nOn the other hand , I along with others believe that research about the hidden aspects of universe is redundant for human beings because they are utilizing the money and resources , which are needed by the state for primitive needs . For example , it has been reported in the previous year that , Nasa is been utilizing all the aids from the USA government to make machines which can easily operate in space .However, in my opinion , these patronage of the government are highly needed for the rehabilitation of army and soldiers , who are sacrificing their lives to protect the country . This example proves that , instead of wasting time , energy , money and other resources on exploring universe ,ministry should focus on the indispensible and primitive needs of the society.\n\nTo recapitulate, some might say that exploring universe is beneficial . Whereas , i firmly agree with the notion that , our army requires more attention of resources to be able to serve the country in a better way . Given this situation, it seems that , the government ought to implement funds to accomplish the basic needs of the society and make this world a peacefull place to live in."},{"question":"Should museums and art galleries be free of cost for the general public, or they should be charged for admittance? Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"It has often been argued that whether public places like museums and art galleries should be entry free or there should be an imposition of entrance fee. In my opinion, such places should be free to the public so that everyone must avail the opportunity to visit them.\n\nSome argue that museums and art galleries should be levied even if is a small amount. There are few reasons behind this. Firstly, these places are visited by many people this way it's a great source to boost the economy of a country, by implementing entry free they would generate a large amount, this money could be used for the maintenance and renovation of museums and galleries and could be used elsewhere as well. Moreover, some people are not interested in arts and museums but they only visit because it's free to enter, by charging such people would refrain from visiting. Thus, overcrowding would be minimised.\n\nIn my opinion, places like these should be entry free. They represent our art, culture and historical values and everyone should visit them regardless of their financial situation. To illustrate, there is a heritage museum in my city which is well equipped with historical data, it is a great source of learning for every individual. However, due to the high cost of entry, many people are unable to visit. This is why government ought to make them free in my opinion.\n\nConcluding this, I would say undoubtedly charging would help to keep a decorum and these place up to date by investing on them, but I strongly favor to make entry free so everyone gets a chance to visit and learn something."},{"question":"Many governments think that economic growth is their most important goal. Some people however think that other types of progess are equally important for a country \nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Economy is always considered to be the backbone of strong nations. Majority of authorities believe that by making their economy stronger they can prosper while its not only monetary basis which helps to build up nations, advancement in every field is a necessity.\n\nThe government prioritises economic growth because financial stability is very essential when it comes to prosperity of a country. The government can provide its civilians with better facilities which will not only make people contented, but it would also refrain them from fleeing their country. According to a research, people live a happy and longer life in financially stable states compared to the poor counterparts. Direct impact of a country's finances is seen in markets and every field job opportunities become higher poverty automatically become lessen.\n\nHowever, progress in other fields are equally important. The government sometimes invested in business and trade that they almost forget about essential fields like education, health care, sports which hold equally important position for a country to sustain stability. Education progress is crucial and need of the hour. It is only education which helps nations to build. Another major field is sports, where national players represent a country. For instance, if our government starts investing in training programs for sports many new talent will emerge which will represent the country in future.\n\nAchievement of a country should not be measured by its economic growth, but other fields like education healthcare system should also be taken into account. The government ought to make efforts for the betterment of every field."},{"question":"The advocates of international aid believe that countries have moral obligation to help each other, opponents consider it unnecessary because money is misspent by the government. Explain both views. Give your opinion also.","answer":"International aid is a financial or technical help given by one country\u2019s government to another country to assist social and economic development or to respond to a disaster in a recipient country. Some people oppose the international aid because they tend to believe that the money goes misspent by the recipient countries. I believe that the allocation of aid like money, equipments and services should not be withheld because they are essential for overall development of a country. Basically, humanitarian aid serves several purposes in recipient countries. \n\nFirstly, its role is vital for recovery of those countries which are going through\/suffering from a natural disaster like earthquake, flood or civil unrest. Life saving support and emergency shelters help the victims to cope up with the challenges of homelessness, food shortage and bring their lives back to normal. For example, in the past, international aid helped the victims of Tsunami and earthquake to recover rapidly and re-build their homes. Secondly, international aid is beneficial for poor\/middle-income countries, as it stead fasts social campaigns related to health, education and provides classrooms, vaccination, access to hygiene education and basic sanitation. On a national security level, it helps to combat terrorism in a country, decreases poverty. Hence, it has important role to strengthen good governance and the economy too.\n\nMoreover, foreign aid is important to foster a conducive diplomatic relationship between the donor and the recipient countries, by moving the impoverished countries towards the democratic fundamentals. Also, it attributes to promote peace and security globally, by opening up the possibility of cultural, social and economic interaction between countries, thereby easing tension. \n\nOn the other hand, the opposition to international aid is rooted in the elements like, any corrupt system in recipient country can cause the money to be misused on unintended destinations, but these pitfalls don\u2019t overshadow the benefits. This issue can be tackled by tight regulations on corrupt system and pressure on recipient country to lead the system on a right path.\n\nIn conclusion, foreign aid really makes a difference to people living in poverty. It provides access to basic necessities and provides people essential conditions for living a peaceful and secure life, although the abuse of international aid can be addressed in strict ways."},{"question":"Some people think that the teenage years are the happiest times of most people's lives. Others think that adult life brings more happiness,in spite of great responsibilities.\nDiscuss both these views and give your opinion.","answer":"Humans pass though different stages of their lives. Every step in the aging process brings alot of reasons to be happy about. The argument of whether teenage or adult years of someone's life are the happiest is supported and refuted by many. Both sides of the arguments will be analyzed before a reasoned conclusion is drawn.\n\nFirstly, teenagers have little or no responsibilities on them. For instance, they do not have to worry about the finances they need for their day to day activities like going on trips, buying some equipments for the sports they are interested in or even shopping. This makes them to enjoy their youth without any financial worry. Therefore,teenager time is considered to be the happiest compared to the adults.\n\nHowever,on the other hand,despite having many domestic and social responsibilities adults are more independent in the choices they make for a happier life. Travelling to an international tourist spot, for example,is an enjoyable activity and being a self-reliant individual,one can easily manage and bear its expenses. This is something that can be fully enjoyed in the adult stage of life which brings more joy and happiness.\n\nIn summary, both sides of the arguments regarding happiness in the two particular life stages have strong support. However, after analyzing Both,in my opinion the idea of being autonomous as an adult with more degree of freedom is more appealing and the positive aspects of the debate over happiness in the teenage years will always be stronger."},{"question":"Some people think that parents should teach children how to be good members of society. Others, however, believe that school is the place to learn this. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Children learn from myriad of influences. Some members of society believe that guardians are responsible for children's behaviour in a society. While others contest that teaching institutions should take it's responsibility. In my opinion, parents hold much more importance in making their children responsible adults.\n\nChildren's first institution is their home. Long before joining the school they start their learning process and their mentors are parents. If parents teach their children manners at an early age they will obey them for the rest of their lives. To illustrate, it is proven from studies that those students ,whose parents are attentive to them and teach them, perform better in school and in surrounding. Thus it is clear that proper parental guidance is indeed crucial.\n\nOn the other hand, some people believe school are responsible. It is for this reason that students spend majority of their time in school anf follow the teachers religiously. For Instance, if teachers command students to behave well and follow instructions they would do so. Moreover, collaborative homework and problem solving also brings class fellows close to each other and instead of competing they become friends. This behaviour reflects in everyday life making them good members of society.\n\nTo conclude, school undoubtedly hold importance but, parental guidance is the pivotal element for pupils to become skilled members of society. Parents are well aware with their child's weaknesses and can work on them with love and divine attention."},{"question":"At the present time the population of some countries includes a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of old people. Do the situation outweigh the disadvantages. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"In recent years, world population is effected to a large extent where mortality ratio of young people have declined significantly this in turn caused the rise of adult population while the population of older people have relatively decreased compared to the past.\n\nYoungsters and adults are considered to be the spine of a nation. They are active and filled with enthusiasm when it comes to work for a country middle aged people are always preferred in every field because the amount of hard work they put in is always justified. For instance, civil services of my country have an age limit to appoint so they can train their officers without any hurdle. Moreover, adolescent are usually observed getting involved in welfare work and social campaigns which helps in prosperity of a nation.\n\nSome others contested that longevity of older people is a need of time where youth have forgotten their values and do not follow their peers. In this era if older people lives longer they can promote the culture and values to the next generations. For example due to the fast paced lifestyle of today's youth they don't interact with their elders this is the reason why many traditions are dying. In addition to this having our forefathers with us is a blessing we can ask for their expert advices because of the experience.\n\nIn my opinion increment in the ratio of adults have found to be more beneficial, because they help running the engine of a nation in a great manner by providing every effort needed."},{"question":"Some people believe that allowing children to make their own choices on everyday matters (such as food, clothes and entertainment) is likely to result in a society of individuals who only think about their own wishes. Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"It is often said that, if children are allowed to decide there everyday matters they would grow up being self-absorbent. However, from my perspective the idea of letting children to decide according to their interests contribute to make them more confident and responsible individuals.\n\nOn one hand, children have their own minds like adults. Not all children have same interests. If they always follow orders from their parents and teachers then they might get too much dependent on others. Hence, they will lack confidence to complete any task by themselves. Undoubtedly, this would not be helpful for their upbringing. If they get the freedom to choose their activities like, choosing their garments or picking their hobbies then they would learn to easily manage their responsibilities eventually. This would also help to build their personalities strongly as they continue to grow up.\n\nOn the other hand, telling and making them to do exact the same as adults want them to perform in their daily chores can make them bored or demotivated. This could affect their enthusiasm to complete their routine tasks. In addition, if adults create a restricted environment for children instead of explaining them to develop their sense for fair and unfair then they would get confused and rebellious.\n\nTo summarise, children need proper support, care and supervision for their regular affairs but that does not mean they always need to be told what should be done. To build up strong characteristics they need to learn how to make decisions for their daily matters which would also help them to become sensible human beings."},{"question":"Please evaluate my essay: Some people believe that robots are important for humans to develop their future while some people think that it is a dangerous invention, that will impact the society negatively. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Science has revolutionised the human life by its astonishing creations, one such creation of science are robots. Nowadays two different opinions are present in society regarding robots, one is in favour which suggests that robots are essential for the progress of human being. Whereas other believes that it would be hazardous for the society. I m going to elaborate both the views and eventually present my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, robots are necessary for individuals who are aspiring for successful future because it has reduced work load of humans, as robots have capacity to do work accurately and quickly so, humans are no longer required to put as much effort as they used to incorporate in their work. Previously before the advant of robotic technology humans work so hard as they are vulnerable to make mistakes. Indeed, in orders to correct those errors sufficient amount of energy and time was required but now, everything has become so effortless. For example, a local cafe in uk, had an accountant who was making emance mistake in updating accounts after so many trials explaining and rectifying mistake of different accountants the honour had decided to replace the post of accountant with automatically operated robotic machine. As a result of using robot for handling all his transaction lot of his work had been reduced and he no longer have to spend hours in correcting silly mistakes of his accountants. By this it can be estimated that robots can decrease work load of humans.\n\nOn the contrary, some population hold the view that artificial intelligence is an omnious creation, it can produce detrimental effects on society, because it has opened the door of war and terror on humans. As robotics has progressed a lot in recent years it has become possible for nations to target their enemies who are living at a distance of millions of miles away without even physically going there, certainly not only targets countries can kill natives of other nations and can destroy property and valuable goods of eachother for sake of hate and jealousy. For instance if we take the example of drone attacks which has created devastating impact by killing thousands of people without even discriminating who is guilty and who is innocent. Therefore, it can be assumed that robots can prove to be fatal for mankind.\n\nTo conclude, despite the fact that robots can detoriate human lives, i am of opinion robots are helping humans to achieve success by saving their time and energy. As far as atomic bombing is concerned it can be used cautiously to eliminate terrorist. Moreover it can be predicted that ise of robots in daily life would be increase to cope up with the needs of today's world."},{"question":"Some people think that it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools. Others, however, believe that boys and girls benefit more from attending mixed school.\nDiscuss both and give opinion.","answer":"It is often argued that children should study in segregated schools to achieve better results, while some suggest single-sex schools provide more advantages to the students. Although separate schools prevent distraction among pupils, I believe that mixed-schools prepare students for their future.\n\nOn the one hand, single-sex schools provide an opportunity to students to remain focus on school subjects. This is to say that opposite sex tend to attract their counterparts and try to impress peers all the time during the school. Boys and girls waste a huge amount of time in order to get attention from opposite gender and lose focus from their studies. However, single-sex schools do not persuade boys and girls to waste time to get attention from peers, so that students will put all of their effort on their education. For example, a recent survey showed that boys from co-education secured very low grades in their intermediate examination as compared to the students who attended separate schools. However, I believe that this problem can be overcome by strict regulation in schools.\n\nOn the other hand, co-education allows students to prepare for their adult life. These schools promote boys and girls to develop their interpersonal skills and learn about teamwork so that they will utilise those skills in their practical lives. This happens because learning and studying together create awareness among students about dealing and interacting with the opposite gender. For example, people who studied in single-schools find difficulties in an interview for jobs as they lack certain social skills, such as communication as compared to those who attended mixed schools. This is why this essay believes that mixed-schools are the need of a society in order to develop social skills among students.\nTo conclude, while same-sex schools encourage pupils to concentrate more on curriculum, I believe that mixed-schools allow students not only to study but also to develop soft skills."},{"question":"Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like .Other believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"People have various views about this approach that pupils should choose the subjects in university according to their own choice while other prospective is that one should give priority to those fields which will be beneficial in terms of money like engineering, medicine etc. \n\nI would argue that it is better for every young individual to know about his strengths in order to choose suitable profession according to his own interest. I strongly believe on the broader approach is that by selecting the subjects as per student own aptitude might be more beneficial in terms of career aspect or financial aspect as it has been proven by various studies that if person`s passion and profession is same then he can lead in that particular field. For instance, one of my friends completed his MBBS degree just for sake of his parents\u2019 choice but he didn\u2019t find any interest in doing doctor\u2019 s job . So he started to teach medical students as he loves to teach. Now he is an owner of four tuition centers of the city in which he is earning more than an ordinary doctor. Thus, it has been proven from my example that person\u2019s own passion can play vital role for his career growth and success.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s illusion that money is the key element for deciding the subjects in universities because usually pupils choose their subjects like information technology, medicine or engineering as these fields are in demand in professional market. Artist and musicians, for instance, are known for choosing a path that they love, but that does not provide them with enough money to live comfortably and raise a family, so it is clearly seen from my example that many young individuals choose their fields based on future needs which is financial factors as compare to jobs or fields based on their interest or enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, while money certainly affect people\u2019s choice of professions, but I still believe that money can\u2019t outweigh all other motivators like passion or interest which is the core element in any profession for success."},{"question":"Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and academic world. Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"It has long been a hot topic for cross-talk that whether or not the various types of information coming from science, academia, or commerce may be shared with others, with some being in its favor while others going against it, finding it as a loss of information of utmost importance. This essay will throw light on both of these views before a reasoned conclusion shall be drawn at the end.\n\nAt one of this discussion lies the view of sharing the data from studies in various walks of life with anyone around. This would hold true of the information that is meant for the benefit of general public and which must be shared as widely as it goes. For instance, research articles, field surveys, disease treatment guidelines, new arrivals in the literature, new statistics etc. are all valuable and precious but must not be kept from their audience and anyone they are meant to have an effect on.\n\nHowever, at the other end of this bipolar view lies a rather stricter approach of a different school of thought, stating that the facts and figures obtained from studies should be kept secret as they are too important to be given away that easy. However, this attitude is far too negative to gain any positive views since spreading knowledge is what it is meant for and any information, no matter how much valuable, must be disclosed to credit its origin. For example, if the results of an important medical investigation about the mechanism of spread of a contagious disease are not published for the public, it is, in no way, going to serve its purpose of conduct resulting in loss of the so called \u201cimportant and precious\u201d information.\n\nIn conclusion, the spread of information should never be limited and a restriction on giving away data based merely on ill well is a despicable waste of knowledge and a set back to the motivation for scientific and academic pursuit."},{"question":"Some people choose to eat no meat or fish. They believe that this is not only better for their own health but also benefits the world as a whole.\nDiscuss this view and give your own opinion.","answer":"It has been argued by some that abstaining from consuming meat and fish in not only good for personal well being but also for the betterment of this planet. I disagree with this statement since eating meat has its own fruits for the human's health as well as for the earth's ecosystem.\n\nTo explain the view of total restraint from fish and meat, i would put forward the theory of absolute non-violence presented by a number of philosophers. They considered the use of animals for food an offence and took it for a manifestation of the violent behavior of mankind. Followers of these theories are popular nowadays as vegetarians.\n\nHowever this view has been disapproved by modern scientific explanation of the classic philosophical theories. The positive impact of utilization of food from animal sources has benefits that are manifold, ranging from being a rich source of protein to being a natural method of biological control. Proteins are an essential part of human body and they must be taken in required amount per day in order to maintain the integrity of the cells. Missing them in food may lead to malnutrition. Similarly, the natural system of controlling the population of, and its effect on ecosystem, by one organism through placing it below another one in the food chain would be disturbed if we dont consume meat or fish in our food.\n\nIn conclusion, the view of not having meat or fish or meat in one's diet has long been supported for its positive impact on personal and global health but is nullified by modern research for its negative consequences. it is no in fact promoted as an important measure to avoid malnutrition and to maintain balance in ecosystem."},{"question":"Some people work for the same organization all their working life other think it is better to work with different organizations. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Some people believe that it is useful to try working with different companies, while others argue that one should work only with one organisation throughout their lives. In my opinion, working with one organisation have better prospects.\n\nSome believe that a person should try to work with different companies; as it brings innovation and boost creativity. To illustrate, when a person works at a same place performing same task with same method then there are chances to loose interest in that job. also a person would not learn anything new. If the same person works with different organisations his working capabilities would be boosted by adopting different skills. For example, there was a chemistry teacher in our town who taught for many years. Later, when she joined a chemistry lab she realised that her skill are actually more helpful and applicable here.\n\nOn the other hand, some people including me are of the opinion that a person should stick to only one job. If a person is related to a company and performing same job for years he would master his work and no one can perform that work better then him. If we switch jobs then it would take a lot of time to adjust to a new place and learn its rules and regulations. Working with one organisation also increases chances for employers to get promoted easily because they are highly skilled and experienced. This is why working in a same organization helps in terms of familiarity and thus better performance.\n\nTo conclude, some may favour the notion of trying new jobs but in my opinion, being consistent is the key to success. It bring the best in your and makes you professionally stable."},{"question":"Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like.

This essay agrees that importance of key subjects cannot be negated but subject selection should be rest with students\u2019 choice. In the remaining essay discussion about the both views will be carried out.\n\nUniversities offered a wide range of key subjects to the students including mathematics, science and technology, medicines and engineering. Some of these subjects have bright jobs prospective that attracts the most of the students to study them and find good job in the future. Moreover, these key subjects are compulsory for one to become specialized in specific field. For instance doctors specialized in medicine must have skills in composition and action of drugs on human body. So, studying medicine courses is compulsory for the doctor to become master in this field regardless of his interests. This is evident that key subjects and skills are important in job.\n\nIn spite of these arguments, I believe university students must pursue their interests and have choice to choose the subject they like most. Society will get more benefits from the persons who are specialized in the field of their interests. Beside this, no one can predict the importance of subject in near future, along with this, it may be happened that employer begins to prefer creative thinking skills over practical and technical skills. One of the renowned local singer ABC is the prime example who pursued his interests in singing despite of the fact that he is the student of science and technology subject. So, it is clear that choice of subjects must be according to likeness of students to perform well in specific area but still interests cannot be held with subject selection.\n\nIn conclusion, although key subjects have good and bright future but still master in subject of interest will produce more creative thinkers. I believe that proper guidance to students before the selection of subjects is beneficial and allow students to choose the subjects of their interests."},{"question":"Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime.Others,however argue that the circumstances of individual crime and the motivation for committing it,should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.Discuss both views and give your opinion.","answer":"Crime rates are increasing exponentially all over the world.The argument is based on the idea as to whether fixed punishments should be there for wrong doers for every type of crime or there situations should be taken into consideration.In the following paragraphs both the sides will be discussed before reaching a well reasoned conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, everybody should be considered equal in front of law.Keeping this in mind many people often argue that for every type of crime punishments should be alloted.All this would act as a deterrent for any individual thinking to indulge in an unlawful task as that person is aware that under no circumstances one would be exempted.Take Dubai, as an example.Gold shops donot have locks, still there is no case of robbery being reported as civilians have fear of facing harsh punishments.As this example, clearly shows the need of fixing punishments.\n\nOn the flip side, I support the view that consideration should be given to the circumstances under which the crime is done. At times there is a prolonged medical condition,peer pressure or mental shocks which acts as triggers in doing illegal activities. Such offenders are situational ones and donot bear any past criminal record.To illustrate, poverty is the reason many children in the developing nations turn to a career of crime so as to feed their families.So it is quite evident that only after analysing the motive of crime the punishments should be allocated.\n\nHaving considered range of arguments, I am of the opinion that rather than fixed punishments, reason or real motive behind the unlawful activity should be kept in mind before giving any verdict to the convict.I hope governments world wide follow this trend."},{"question":"Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"All offenders have to face punishment as they break the law and their punishment depends on the level of crime they have committed. Some people think law should should not be broken at any cost and if anyone dares to break it, he should be given strict punishment regardless of his conditions. On the other hand, people with soft hearts believe that punishment should be given but it must depend on the offenders age, family conditions, responsibilities etc.\n\nFirstly, some people strongly urge that fixed punishments are necessary as it will stop people from committing any sort of offense. Criminals should not be given relaxation. They have to pay for their sins as quick as possible. Even, there are groups who want these punishments should be publically given, so that it can become a example for future criminals. For example, Saudi Arabia, they publically hang the offenders in the market and in the result, they have a much lower crime rate than other neighborhood countries.\n\nIn m opinion, criminals should be given a chance to correct their mistakes. They have to be given special cells according to their age and level of crime. Even before the decision in the court, they have to be given appropriate time to tell the court their circumstances and responsibilities that dragged them towards the crime. I will say, even their academic and family background should be considered before the decision. If the decision is given in their favor, they will try to become a good human being and can be an asset for the society in the near future.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to state that responsibilities on offender should be considered before the decision of punishment. Slight favor may change the criminal into a good human being and this will be beneficial for our society."},{"question":"In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.","answer":"A hand full of people are earning exorbitantly in various nations. Although it is considered by some that it is beneficial for the country, others and I believe, the fixed amount should be allocated to them. Both sides will be discussed in this essay.\n\nOn the one hand, those who are in favour, believe that they are the cream of the nation, not everyone is capable enough to shoulder responsibilities at national and international level. The core of this argument is that those have gained positions, which is merely impossible for others to reach without an extreme struggle, hard work and dedication. Take bureaucracy for example, in Pakistan, one has to clear CSS exam which has only 2% passing percentage after which they are given highest ranks in their respected fields. These bureaucrats are the pillars of any country, as they help fortify by making or refining legislation as per requirement. Thus it is evident that such people must be paid highly in terms of income.\n\nOn the other hand, others and I believe, providing large sum can burden the economy. Limiting the salary, garnered wealth can be utilized in other sectors like health and education. For instance, a common genetic disease haemophilia is common among children that requires blood transfusion every now and then, that can be expensive for many mediocre families.catalysing such transfusion hubs, more and more average citizen will be benefitted, lengthening their lifespan and a better life ahead.\n\nTo conclude, while many people vary in their opinion, I firmly believe that limited salaries ought to be allocated so that other building blocks to run a nation can be invested."},{"question":"There seems to be an increasing number of serious crimes committed each year. While some think the best way is to use the death penalty as a deterrent, many people believe that other measures will be needed.\nDiscuss both sides.","answer":"Serious crimes have become widely pervasive,and the way to offer punishment is a real matter of debate. While some think that death sentance is the way should be chosen to penalize those who commit serious crimes, others suppose that there are alternative ways to descepline offenders. This essay will discuss both sides of the debate.\n\nOn one hand,some people argue that death penalty is the ultimate way to put paid to this widespread of serious crimes, and they support their point of view withe legitimate reasons. First, dooming serious crime perpetrators to death is the only way to terrify those with intentions and inclinations to carry out such kind of criminal acts. For instance Statistical studies point out that Muslim countries have the lowest percentages of homicides, humen trafficking and drug dealing because they have execution as punishment for these deeds. Furthermore, It has to be mentioned that all the previous attempts to fight serious crimes have proven its failure, whereas studies demonstrate that the percentage of crimes has doubled in the last decade. These people have good reasons to see that death penalty is the best punishment to rein crime.\n\nOn the other hand, many people find that other tackles could be done to counteract serious crime. Since a lot of criminal acts come out as a result of temporary outrage, not all wrongdoers should be looked at as genuine criminals, and hence the prosecutors should calibrate when they make verdicts. For instance those people who found guilty could be used as labourers to serve with no or minimum wages. Eventually death penalty is seen by many as wasting of the humen resource and is not a wise choice to be made. For these reasons the wholesomeness of death penalty is doubted by many people.\n\nShould all perpetrators of serious crimes be doomed to death? Many people think that this is the best way to descepline the society. While some other disagree and suggest that many other strategies are effective. This essay discussed both sides of the debate and the various reasons that second each notion."}]},{"title":"Two-Part Question","content":[{"question":"Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology.\nIn what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?","answer":"With the advent of the leading edge technology, a human interaction has been experiencing tremendous changes. As a result, this ever-increasing trend has already had a negative impact on the types of relationships people have. This essay will show some of the ways the human interaction has been affected and suggest several reasons to consider this as a welcome development.\n\nIn the face of how beneficial the technology has become in peoples lives, there are several plausible counters to this. Having been invented, the advanced technology capacitated human beings to keep in touch with each other even through the remote distance; however, this is a double-edged sword as it has continuously been affecting relationships, creating a wide gap between people. For a case in point, according to a poll conducted by Socio-solve an organization helping to maintain the social communication almost 60% of interviewees were showing the activeness in the use of technology as the main reason for the break-up with their soulmates. Thus, it further fortifies the view that the arrival of technology has had numerous negative ramifications on the types of relationships which would, otherwise, be cemented.\n\nGranted, it has now been deemed harmful to have a relationship through the virtual world, this, on the other hand, does have benefits in the favour of businessmen. This is mainly because, almost two decades ago, it would have been unimaginable to have a business meeting via Skype or other sundry applications. On top of that, if the entrepreneurs had their job done by means of a technology without having to attend the meeting hall, this would result in saving tremendous amounts of time, which could be spent on other significant works. A good example is a company called iBoard in my hometown where the businessmen always rely on the technology to have a business relationship with their partners, hence having an effective time schedule in their office. Therefore, it is certainly a positive development on the account of benefits the business world is gaining.\n\nIn conclusion, having the technology interfered with the relationships is considered as the welcoming upheaval in light of betterments in a business communication, albeit with some downsides such as losing touch with each other. It is my fervent hope that with a much closer attention, the negative reverberations of the current trend will fall entirely away."},{"question":"Children who start reading earlier in life, perform better later on in their school studies.\nHow important are early reading skills in a child?s academic performance?\nWhat other preschool factors influence a child?s later academic achievements?","answer":"Learning is very important for all humans as it teaches them discipline. Many say that pupils who start the process of learning and reading at an early stage do not perform better in their future academic life, although, it is agreed that reading along with other favourable conditions boosts a childs IQ.\n\nMinors are helped by good reading skills in their academic career in many ways as this is a dynamic activity. This boosts their communication skills as it is a multitasking process, which helps the neurological development. The Young toddlers brain is programmed in such a way that it picks and familiarizes with new terms fast, when compared to adults which assists them in their academic life. Furthermore, this also helps them in gaining self confidence because whatever they learn during early reading sessions is automatically employed in their advanced curriculum in a direct or an indirect way. All of these points are augmented by many studies that reading in early childhood is fruitful for pupils in the future, especially in academia, along with a suitable environment.\n\nThe good environment is provided by many factors for boosting the studying skills of minors. One of them is the overall relationship between parents and kids. A strong bond between them creates mental stability, which minimally interferes with their thinking process thus, boosting their performance. Another factor which can be attributed to better academic achievement in the future, is to provide a balanced and nutritious diet to young students because this helps in neuronal growth, which along with reading skills leads to good studying skills in school.\n\nHaving discussed points in favour of reading at an early stage of life, it is clear that reading at an early age is undoubtedly essential for academic achievement along with proper diet and overall good relationship with parents"},{"question":"As most people spend a major part of their adult life at work, job satisfaction is an important element of individual's wellbeing. What factors contribute to job satisfaction? How realistic is the expectation of job satisfaction for all workers?","answer":"Workplaces have now become the places where many adults spend significant proportions of their time at, thus making a sense of job fulfillment the core component of people\u2019s welfare. This essay will provide key aspects leading to job satisfaction and suggest that ensuring the entire workforce is content with their jobs is practically impossible.\n\nThere are a large number of crucial factors contributing to the job fulfillment. The main one is the amount of wage people receive for what they do, which is markedly different in various positions. In other words, if it were not for a handsome salary, most of the employees would have already ended up leaving their jobs. Apart from this, it is vitally important to provide workers with different types of bonuses, extra perks for what they have done, with a view to boosting their productivity. For example, people could be given more holiday entitlements to have a proper relaxation that is necessary for coping with a giant boatload of work in their offices. Thus, a clear link between these aspects of work and the job satisfaction can be seen.\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that it seems unrealistic for all workers to have a contentment with their jobs. The main reason for this view is that the job fulfillment, if considering the labor force in a single company, cannot be reached on account of a wide gap between the amounts of the salary of workers. As a pay parity does not exist in the mass of companies, this will not act as an incentive to clear up their heavy workloads. As a consequence, workers cannot expect the pay rise which has evidently become a pipe dream and it would feel as if they were being used as a sweated labor. Therefore, it is impossible to have a general satisfaction from a job for the whole workforce.\n\nIn the light of these facts, one can conclude that the success of a particular workplace hinges on the productivity of workers which can be achieved by the high amount of salaries and perquisites. However, the sense of job satisfaction cannot prevail among all workers because of the income inequality."},{"question":"Car ownership has increased so rapidly over the past thirty years that many big cities are now a one big traffic jam. \nHow true do think this statement is? \nWhat measures can government take to discourage people from using their cars?","answer":"It is true that there has been a greatly increased trend in personal car possession over the period of last three decades. As a result today with the fairly large proportion of population travelling in car, the cities have become more congested as compared to past, especially the metropolitan cities. This essay will discuss elements related to the problem of traffic jam and present some viable solution to them. \n\nFirstly, while analyzing the cause of this problem, it is noted that one of the main factors contributing to the situation is the lack of public friendly mass transit systems. So one of the best approach governments can take is making public transport more approachable by increasing the means of transport, for example, subways and metro bus services. Not only this but steps should also be taken to regulate public transport fares as this is one of the several reasons why people prefer to buy their own means of transport. For instance, in many developed countries this system is already serving as cheap, efficient and reliable means of commute for public. And as a result less chaotic traffic situations. \n\nSecondly, government can implement raise in toll tax and road tax. This means by increasing taxes people will prefer public transport over their own. For example, if a person, who is frequent car user, has to pay double the amount of road taxes for his daily travel to work he will definitely consider public transport more beneficial. \nSome other measures that could be proven beneficent by their strict implementation are carpooling, restriction of car ownership to one per family and decreasing subsidies for car manufacturers. These all would reduce the number of cars to a considerable amount and eventually be a way forward to resolve the traffic congestion. \n\nIn conclusion, overwhelming increase in car ownership in recent years has undoubtedly resulted in worst traffic situations in many big cities of the world. By taking some of the aforementioned initiatives this issue and its deleterious effects can be resolved."},{"question":"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business ,hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?","answer":"It is an in arguably true that computers perform important role in the human life. In the modern era, mostly people dependent on computers and their every work accomplish with the help of computer. I believe that computers will be used in many purposes as like as business, hospitals and crime detection. I think that computer is very helpful for humans and I am going to mention the pros and cons in the upcoming paragraphs.\n\nIt is certainly true to say that computer is widely used by humans in many criterias and it will also prove very beneficial for individuals. one of the main point consider that computers will improve the crime rate. To be more precise, computer will tap the locations where the crime is committed and also helps to track the location of criminal and arrest them. another point is considered that computer will also used in the aeroplanes. Moreover computer will replace by the pilot and easily fly without the pilot.\n\nApart From this, there are many advantages to dependent on computers. One of the main advantage is time consuming. In other words, people are complete their work in a short time with the help of computer. on the other hand, people also pay attention to the drawback of computer. Main drawback is that people often spend their time Time on computers. due to this they faces many diseases as like as obesity and also effect on eye sights.\n\nIn a conclusion, folks should be used the computer in limited and they also pay attention to problematic area of computers."},{"question":"Some parents by their children whatever they ask for, and allow their children to do whatever they want. Is this a good way to raise children? What type of consequences could this type of parenting have for children as they get old?","answer":"In recent years, many parents provide children with everything they desire for and put no restriction on their activities. In my opinion, such type of up bringing is the worst form of parenting , as it may have detrimental impact on the future of children. I will further strengthen my argument with reasons and examples in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nBuying everything for children and allowing them to live their own life are terrible way of parenting because of multiple reasons. Parents are supposed to teach their children about right and wrong, for this they must put some restriction on children. Letting them to do things according to their wish may prone them to indulge in bad activities. Take example of my brother for an illustration, who being youngest in the family is very dear to my parents; parents never put any restriction on him, consequently, he left school and also involved in drug addiction. Moreover, the habit of providing everything to children may put parents in deep trouble in future , because children expenses like education, tuition increase with age and it might be impossible for parents to buy expensive things in future. In line with this arguments , it proves that bringing up children in this way is sub standard way of parenting.\n\nIt certainly will has detrimental impacts on children latter in their life. On first place , children are fascinated by wrong doings and without any check and balance they are more incline towards bullying, delinquencies, and truancy , ultimately lead to poor performance in academics. Another serious ramification lies in the destruction of personality. Since ,children develop habit of buying everything but later in life it may be impossible for them to get the desired things, which evoke the sense of deprivation and inferiority.On the basis of it, one can say that this style of parenting has significant drawbacks.\n\nTo conclude , the aforementioned arguments prove that providing children with every good and allowing them to do whatever they want are not only the worst style of parenting but also have profound impacts on future of children"},{"question":"In many schools, sport and exercise classes are being replaced by academic subjects.\nWhat is your opinion about this?\nWhat are it's effects on children's lives?","answer":"The movement of replacing physical activity related classes to course specific ones have become a topic of hot debate amongst individuals. I am of the belief that it has far-reaching negative implications. In this essay, the significant impacts like reduced overall development along with remaining unaware of the hidden talents of younger generations, will be discussed, before reaching a cogent conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, the elimination of body related exercises is harmful for a number of reasons. First of all, the students will be busy with their studies all the time, which in turn, would cause hindrance in their overall growth. As a result, they will lack interpersonal skills, which are quite important in this competitive world. For instance, a recent study showed that the children who participates in physical exercises, outperform in their studies as well. Thus, it is quite safe to say that for the complete growth of children in all aspects, inclusion of physical sports classes, is mandatory.\n\nIn addition to this, the hidden talents in children will remain unexplored with the exclusion of body related activities. A consequence would be that they will never come to know about their real interests and talents. With this, they would not be able to achieve greater heights and contribute for the well-being of society. For example, the former captain of Indian Cricket team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, got to know his real passion, while he was playing a friendly match. With his friends. Therefore, sports and exercise classes hold a significant importance in exploring the unseen talents of children.\n\nTo conclude, it is crystal clear from the above discussion that the unforeseeable negative impacts of excluding physical activity classes requires special attention. Hence, I believe that there should be sports and exercise classes and their exclusion is highly discouraged."},{"question":"Today more and more people are travelling than ever before.\nWhy is this the case?\nWhat are the benefits of travelling for the traveller?","answer":"When compared to the past, the percentage of those who prefer to travel has increased considerably. In this essay we will discuss about the factors that have contributed to this change, and the benefits of going on tours.\n\nLet us start by discussing about the causes for this upward trend. A major reason is the increase in number of men and women who earn while they are studying. Lots of school and college students can be seen doing part time and full time jobs during holidays and semester breaks, saving their money so that they can go on trips in future. The Travel Guide magazine, in one of its articles stated that out of those who travelled abroad, 40% are teenagers or college students.Furthermore, cheaper air and sea fares encouraged more number of people to travel to foreign destinations. In 2016, American Airlines company recorded an increase in air travellers by 30%, when ticket rates dropped by 10%.\n\nNow, we will discuss about the advantages of such travels for sightseers. Firstly, it enables them to adpat to any situation , which may come in handy when they have shift or migrate abroad owing to study or work reasons. Many students and immigrants who have travelled abroad claim that it was easier for them to be blend in with their new home and lifestyle. Secondly, they get experience cultures and lifestyle of people that are completely different from theirs.\n\nTo sum up, the increase in travellers can be related to more number of youngsters opting to travel, by which they can experience and appreciate the cultures and lifestyles of others."},{"question":"There are many different types of music in the world today .why do we need music ? Is the traditional music of a country more important then the international music that is heard everywhere nowadays.","answer":"Nowadays music has become the prime source of relaxation. Several categories of melodies are introduced daily . Some people assume local music to be classic as compare to the music which is famous globally.However, others do not agree with it . I firmly agree with the above statement that traditional music is significant to reflect the cultral inheritage of a country .\n\nFurthermore, long established music of a country depicts the particular identity of the residents of nation. For example , Sindhi folk music represents the stories, cultures and histories associated with the inhabitants of sindh province . In addition , it symbolizes the affection and emotions of the natives towards culture . This helps the new generation to explore their customs and traditions , while international music on the other hand is unable to recognise all these aspects . This proves that traditional music carries huge importance in society .\n\nMoreover , there is another aspect to this argument. Many people think that international music is versatile. However , certain additions to melodies are not equally acceptable by every individual .for instance , the introduction of rap music is not admissible by every individual because they do not understand it easily . Instead , they prefer to listen to their traditional songs , which sounds melodious to them . As a result , traditional tunes gains more importance then international tunes .\n\nTo conclude , i personally believe that a person puts more attention and pay more interest to things which are related to their own indentity and music is just the same . Traditional music of a nation is very important to introduce the customs and culture of a nation , globally . Traditional music should be given more limelight as compare to the international music."},{"question":"Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? Has this been a positive or negative development?","answer":"This is true that technology has altered the way people communicate, and this trend has brought various changes in different types of relationships. In my opinion, there are both advantages and drawbacks.\nTechnology has made several impacts on relationships in different aspects, such as education, business and social life. \n\nFirstly, the relationship between teachers and students used to be closed because the process of learning was physically limited within a venue, but now we can study via internet such as searching articles on google website or watching videos on youtube. Interaction would seldom be involved and hence teachers almost are disappeared. Secondly, cooperation between companies would also be reformed. Business could be completed through emails or video meeting. Comparing with the situation in the past, businessmen had to make appointments and discuss the details face to face. Finally, social life style has enormously affected as well. People nowadays communicate via whatsapp and facebook instead of making phone call, and they prefer sharing their daily life on instagram to meeting friends in reality.\n\nI believe this phenomenon has led both positive and negative outcomes. Regarding the advantage, these technological applications have shortened the distance, for instance, if I travel overseas, I can still keep in touch with my family and friends without time and space limitation, I can share what I have experienced with them immediately. On the contrary, people get used to interact with others via screen but not a real person, they would gradually lose confidence to talk to people face to face and this would hinder their social skills.\n\nIn conclusion, new technology have brought myriad changes to people\u2019s interaction. This has improved the communication method but also has raised some problems."},{"question":"Increasing number of people are choosing cosmetology surgery to improve their appearance? What are the reasons?\nDo you think its a positive or a negative development?","answer":"Nowadays, grear number of people are very curious to improve their looks and fir this purpose they are inclined towards following the trend of cosmetic surgery. In this essay, firstly i will highlight the causes of this rising vogue, than secondly i will oppose this argument as for me its not an optimistic approach. \n\nTo begin with, the fashion of cosmetic surgery is prevailing rapidly because of immense influence of media industry on general public. As movies, dramas and magazines are showing the picture of humans which is larger than life and far more beautiful than reality which inspires public tremendously. Hence, in order to look as flawless as their favourite celebrity appear on tv screen people are going through thase artificially beautifying surgeries.for example, a pole was conducted among those individuals who have gone through recreational surgeries, in that pole people had to select a reason for making this choice of getting surgery done. Not surprisingly, 70 out of 100 people had chosen the reason that they have been inspired by some celebrity. So, results have proved that popularity of cosmetic surgery is due to the effect of media.\n\nIndeed cosmetic surgeries are affecting society negatively because its waste of money. The reason behind such substantial amount of investment is to gain confidence by enhancing their out look through artificial techniques, but in actual scenerio this purpose doesn't usually get fulfill. It is due to the fact that confidence lies in believing themselves and it only comes when someone starts accepting himself as the way he has been created by his creator not by making artificial changes in the structure of the body. For example young people aspiring to be successful actor are perfect sample for showing how the money has been squanderedby them, in terms of cosmetic surgery in order to gain confidence in front screen. As many of them who have become phenomenal look wise as a result of these surgical techniques have still failed to conquer the milestone of success in acting career. On the contrary, some actors who haven't even spend a penny for rectifying their appearance surgically have reached peak of success in acting. One such person is rowan atkinson( mr. Bean) who is an ordinary looking man with some extra ordinary talent.\n\nTo sum up, cosmetological surgeries are spreading at such a high pace because of media. Moreover, I believe it is not an positive approach as its insensible investment which can not give confidence to anyone. I suggest it should be stopped by providing explaining to public about real concept of beauty and self esteem other, trend of cosmetic surgery would result in making world more judgemental, artificial and materialistic."},{"question":"Some observers say that police officers should be recruited from the communities where they work, so that they have local knowledge. Other people say that this is unnecessary or even undesirable. Where do you stand on this debate?? Is local knowledge essential in modern policing??","answer":"The need for effective and trustworthy police officers is paramount in the police department . While some people believe that the local recruitment of the police officers should be done from areas where they belong, I agree with those who believe that this practice will prove to be entirely non essential because of the level of corruption and familiarity of the local police officers with the potential offenders.\n\nOn the one hand, people who support local hiring of the police officers point to need for the police to understand minutiae of the local community. These people believe that if police department had hired foreigners , they would have never been able to deal with frictions or history of grievances, whether religious or political, a certain society holds. However,this practice could turn out to be negative as the local officers might share some of the tendencies ,who knows that could be a criminal one, with the people they grew up with. To illustrate, a higher incidence of corruption and bribery was observed in the police department of Brazil when they preferred local personals instead of foreigners. Thus, this practice of local hiring of the police officers could not proved to be useful.\n\nOn the other hand, I personally support those who believe that local hiring in the police department could have several drawbacks. This is because , local recruitment of the police officers would lead to biased decisions in favor of some offenders which would lead to failure to enforce law fully. Given this situation, it would be highly injustice towards citizens who abide by the laws and might ruin the whole law and order situation in the local area. Therefore, I support that such police officers should be hired who have transferable skills, such as lateral thinking, and investigative ability rather than looking at areas from where they belong.\n\nOverall, although some people believe that local knowledge would work stupendously if considered at the times of local hiring in the police department, I am of the opinion that risks of local recruitment outweigh its benefits because it would increase the risk of corruption among the police officers and would be a setback to the law and order regulating bodies."},{"question":"It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\nWhat sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children?","answer":"Juveniles should learn to distinguish between correct and abhorrent behavior during their formative years. It is argued that punishment is crucial to accomplishing this goal, a notion that I totally disagree with. In this essay, I will explain why punishment is both ineffective and harmful and I will suggest some punishment modalities that might be harmless and more efficient. \n\nPunishment is detrimental to the mental and developmental well-being of children. When parents or teachers inflict some sort of physical or verbal punishment upon the child, the memory of this hostility is solidified in his memory rather than the mistake that has been made. Recent studies published in the field of pediatric psychiatry have proven that almost all methods used in punishment of children dramatically impact their self-esteem, and form an unhealthy relationship between them in their parents. Furthermore, negative reinforcement seldom helps in modifying behavior as youngsters focus on evading punishment in lieu of learning from their mistakes.\n\nHowever, if punishment has to be used, there are harmless methods that may aid in discplining children. The methods that are to be used must be non-physical and must not fall under the category of child abuse. Additionally, the salient feature of such methods is that they must promote growth-mindset, which would ensure that the child understands and embraces his capability of improvement. A prime example on this is making the child do age-appropriate volunteer work after fully explaining the situation, so that it is clearly understood that this punishment is not a form of anger from the parent\u2019s or teacher\u2019s side.\n\nIn conclusion, I completely disagree with employing punishment to teach children the right and wrong because not only is it deleterious to the child, but also futile in terms of behavior modification. Nonetheless, harmless methods can be implemented as explained above"},{"question":"It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children?","answer":"Coaching for children at an early age has always been debated whole heartedly. Sometimes, not always, punishment is considered essential for both parents and teachers to employ in order to make children distinguish between righteous and morally wrong doings. I largely agree with this notion because of its fruitful results.\n\nFirst of all, it can strongly be argued that teenagers show great deal of discipline with parents\u2019 reprimand. It is obvious that the mild minds will make mistakes, this is something natural and therefore guardians need to harden their attitudes, if not, they will persist in developing this negative attitude. Punishments like not giving pocket money for a day or two has an excellent impact on children\u2019s behaviour. I have seen in my family when children are not paid what they regularly receive from their parents they mend their ways. Similarly, other benefits like chocolates and technological devices not only motivate them but also make them disciplined if taken away when they do not follow the rules.\n\nAdditionally, when I was in school I saw that students learnt the difference between right and wrong with punishment by teachers. Strictness such as burdening students with more and more homework as a result of their misconducts would compel them behave properly. Using swear words is something entirely unethical, any child who is found using swear words should be given special assignment on presenting the dire consequences of offensiveness. In this way not only would they educationally grow but will also morally grow when punishment is constructive.\n\nHaving discussed all above, I would reiterate that constructive punishment at home and educational institutes has always proved productive. Children need advice and sometimes when they go off the track they are then in desperate need of nothing but construct punishment for their future learning."},{"question":"Some people fail in school, but end up being successful in life.\nWhy do you think that is the case?\nWhat is the most important thing to succeed in life?","answer":"Ups and downs are the part and parcel of human\u2019s life. Although some fall short during the earlier part of their educational life, later succeed with the accomplishment of their goals. This essay will shed light on factors that cause backslide of students in school, and the most important elements in life to focus.\n\nOne of the main reasons of pupils fail in school is due to typical educational system. At present, most of the schools focus more on theoretical part such as memorizing things. This causes some of the students to lose focus as they find it less interactive. If institutes introduce more practical application of studies it will be fruitful for all the students, especially for those who think out of the box.\n\nAnother reason of failure is the lack of personal assessment from teachers as well as parents. This is most important substance to consider that what a child\u2019s interest is. For instance, some kids are born artist gifted with rare talent. But in most of the cases, parents and teachers got failed to recognize. This eventually costs that child to lose the talent and also not perform well in academics as well.\n\nDespite of all the above factors one should not lose hope and learn from failure. This is the most thing in journey of life to consider. There is always a lesson hidden in your downfall you need to explore it, gets the benefit out of it.\n\nTo conclude, there are many hurdles in students\u2019 life in the shape of educational system and lack of capabilities assessments. One should learn from the failures to fulfill all the goals of the life."},{"question":"Happiness is considered very important in life.\nWhy is it difficult to define?\nWhat factors are important in achieving happiness?","answer":"Happiness is the key factor for everyone\u2019s stable life. It means a lot for an individual to be happy in different ages of his or her life. It is a strength for survival in ups and downs of life. It is an intangible feeling which comes with the attachment of particular things or individuals.\n\nIt is a very subjective matter to define one\u2019s happiness because it varies from person to person in his or her life. For instance, a mother\u2019s happiness remains in the achievement of her children success, a university student is looking for his or her happiness in higher grades, a doctor gets his happiness on successful completion of the critical operation, a batsman looks for his happiness in his successful maiden century. Therefore, it is not measureable thing on any stage of life but it has a long lasting impact on an individual\u2019s memory.\n\nThere are numerous factors which lead to happiness, such as positive thinking in every odd situation will keep an individual happy. Helping people in need could also lead to achieve happiness. Avoidance of hatred and grudges could also result in happiness such as tolerance at one\u2019s misbehavior and forgiveness on their wrongdoings.\n\nTo conclude, happiness is vital for every living individual in this world. It becomes strength and success for those who seek happiness around there. Happy individuals tend to be healthier and live longer than an unhappy person."},{"question":"Some people fail in school, but end up being successful life.\nWhy do you think that is the case?\nWhat is the most important thing to succeed in life?","answer":"All countries have an educational system which measures students\u2019 knowledge. Many students do not get great results and they cannot graduate from school but some of these people achieve their personal goals and have success in their lives. From my point of view, schooling has standard evaluations to measure students in different places. On the other hand, in schools, there are many fields of study which are not developed and success is achieved when people develop other complementary skills.\n\nEach individual has a unique mindset\/point of view in this world, however since ancient times, our society has tried to make up same standard processes and structures in many different fields such as education. For instance, there are many countries which have set up all kinds of courses or subjects from kindergarten to university and this system created does not give all tools and support to each particular student. Some students cannot feel comfortable and fail because they have other skills not focused on in schools such as painting or drawing.\n\nHowever, success is a relative word that involve many things not just one, and many people achieve this success when they reach a new levels or experience in their lives, for example getting married, launching new projects and getting a job. Moreover, if we define success as having much money, then many rich people have reached their fortune without basic studies and they have achieved these important dreams because they have improved their social skills, improvisation and specific knowledge.\n\nTo conclude, if educational systems pay more attention to each individual and make up a different structure, many students will develop more skills to succeed. Nevertheless, success is not always related with studies, and there are other abilities needed to achieve these personal goals because success is not the same for everyone."},{"question":"Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve the growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do u agree or disagree? What other measure do you think might be effective?","answer":"Pollution is the greatest threat to mankind. It is believed that raising the cost of fuel is the effective solution for traffic congestion and air pollution. I completely disagree with the above notion as there are several other effective ways to reduce pollution.\n\nIncrease in cost of petroleum products is not a salutary solution. This is because more than half of the world's population are rich enough to get luxurious cars. Hence, rising oil prices do not have any kind of impact on this group of people. In addition, in developing countries such as India, public transportation are poorly connected and not maintained. As a result, individuals prefer to commute on their own vehicles rather than public transports. Furthermore, availability of vehicles at cheap rates and providing attractive loans act as a catalyst for an increase in the number of cars in cities.\n\nNevertheless, there are other significant ways to bring down the level of air pollution and traffic in streets. Firstly, promotion and usage of solar powered cars among the public should be encouraged. By doing this, people can be aware of solar cars benefits and there would be a lot of possibilities for people to buy such cars. Secondly, the government should impose a hefty amount of tax on automobiles. As a result, people might buy cars for necessity, but not to portray their status level. For instance, raising tax would make a family think about purchasing a second car.\n\nTo conclude, implementing taxes and making use of electrically powered cars are better solutions to decrease the number of vehicles which taints the atmosphere. Thus, I strongly believe making petroleum products expensive is not a good solution. \u2014 with Rafael Salguero and Favian Alvis Cato Conroy."}]}]
