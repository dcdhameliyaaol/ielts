They appear all over the place from the streets to social media with a high density. For example, there is a multitude of colourful flyers stuck on the street walls in Sydney."},{"question":"Why do you think there are so many advertisements now?","answer":"I guess it’s due to the benefits of the companies. First, advertisements are the easiest way to reach customers to attract their attention to a particular brand or product. From that attractive information, customers will be able to choose an appropriate one. Second, it also plays a crucial role in the marketing strategy that the company apply to attract customers."},{"question":"What are the various places where we see advertisements?","answer":"Advertising is here, there, and everywhere. It gets to people through different types of communication such as flyers and banners on the streets or printed ones on newspaper, magazines or electronic ones on social media. It could be written, verbal or a short movie."},{"question":"How do you feel about advertisements?","answer":"Sometimes, I find it a little bit disappointing because the quality products are usually overrated. However, there are other beneficial advertisements in supermarkets which has informative contents for customers such as on which days there will be promotions or which new products will be launched."}]},{"title":"Art","questions":[{"question":"Do you like art?","answer":"I have a lifelong passion for art since I was a child. Beside the official art class in school, I also joined a drawing class in The Children’ House and my teachers were very pleased with my drawings. I also participated in some drawing competitions back then. Until now I still draw in my free time, although not as often as I used to do."},{"question":"Do you think art classes are necessary? (Why?)/ How do you think art classes affect children’s development?","answer":"Yes, definitely. Learning arts, especially at a young age, can help stimulate children’s cognitive development and encourage them to think outside the box. Because they’re still little, their ideas are very fresh and lovely, which is worth appreciating."},{"question":"Are you good at art?","answer":"Art is a really vast subject, I believe and if it is about drawing things here and there, I would say I am pretty fine at it. But, I am surely not one of those who can make some masterpieces. I think I am good at it, all thanks to the art classes that I attended during my teen years. They were a great help during my growing years and taught me lot of creativity. Now, I can easily draw simple day to day things like pen or a face."},{"question":"What kind of paintings do people like?","answer":"In my opinion, people love hanging landscape paintings at home. Bringing in the beauty of Mother Nature somehow ease people’s mind after a long day at work. Another style of drawing that most people also like is portrait. It could be portraits of someone important to them or even their lovely pets."},{"question":"What benefits can you get from painting as a hobby?","answer":"I think the mediation efficiency worth mentioning first. Colours in some ways reflect our thoughts and emotions very well and somehow stimulate our body to defend against our negativity inside. For me, in particular, I think what’s so interesting about painting is that you have no idea how harmonized colours can become until you actually try."},{"question":"How often do you visit art galleries?","answer":"To tell you the truth, I have never visited art galleries before. Unless I have a guide to acknowledge me, art galleries would be quite boring for me."},{"question":"What kinds of things do you like to draw?","answer":"My main inspiration is Japanese manga. The drawing topic is extremely varied, however only manga seems to show great potency for my level. I have a big collection at home and as I sometimes go through it again, I can see how much I’ve improved."},{"question":"Is it easy to learn how to draw?","answer":"I think I must say it’s even challenging for a lot of people. I absolutely failed when it comes to drawing still life paintings like fruit and flowers. I think for those who succeed in drawing or arts in general, they first must have God-gifted talent, then comes to the long-term commitment to arts that requires extreme practice and high patience."}]}],"part23":[{"title":"Describe an activity that you do after school/work.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an activity that you do after school/work.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What it is?<br>When and Where you do it?<br>Who you do it with?<br>And how you feel about it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Many sites such as Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal have good discounts.</p><p><strong>2.

When I go with my parents, they cannot guide me about the clothes, which are in trend.</p><p><strong>3. What are the disadvantages of shopping in a big mall?<br></strong>In big malls, nobody guides you about any product. You have to use your own judgement. Secondly, you cannot get things on credit, which a small shopkeeper in your town would give you if he knows you. Another disadvantage is that mostly big malls are outside in the suburbs, and so it is only possible to go by your car.</p><p><strong>4. Why do people like to buy branded products?<br></strong>Brands are popular because they provide quality, good after sale service, and also provide status.</p><p><strong>5.

Do you think arguments are important?<br></strong>Arguments have become an essential part of our life because they help us to clarify our thoughts. Arguments change people’s points of view or persuade people to a particular action or behaviour.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, arguments are definitely important because they make us know about the other side of<br>the issues. Arguments happen when we are adamant about something but at the same time,<br>we fail to understand the other side. When we argue we learn about what others think.</p><p><strong>2. What do family members generally argue about?<br></strong>Families often argue about topics related to major and even minor events. Such as selecting a holiday destination. sibling argues for their clothes and other accessories. Older adults are mostly arguing for politician parties, mean which is good.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think arguments happened over small issues like what should be made for dinner or what<br>movie should be watched to big issues like how children should be raised, how should money<br>be spent, marriage decisions, and so on. In case, there is a family business there may also be<br>arguments on how the business should be run. In the end, family members can argue over<br>anything and everything.</p><p><strong>3. Is it easier for you to have arguments with your friends or your family members?<br></strong>A parent’s job is to look out for you and keep you safe. Remember that they don’t want to make things difficult for you. but they want to make sure that you understand their perspective. So it hard to argue with parents because they have much experience and do not continue the argument with them for a long time. On the other hand. arguments with friends are easy because we are a similar age group. and most have a similar thinking level.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think it’s easier for me to have arguments with friends because after having the argument I<br>get the time and space to think about the issue. So, after thinking about it I generally<br>apologise if I think I am wrong or I just apologise for arguing even if I feel I am right. This ends<br>the issue. On the other hand, with family, I don’t get the space. So, sometimes the arguments<br>continue for days.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think people should change the way they think when they have arguments?<br></strong>Arguments means — where tension starts to rise. responses start to get personal. and you go around in circles without getting anywhere. I think people should change the way they feel when they have arguments. People should listen to another person properly before putting his/her points in front of him/her. People should speak in a very decent way so that they do not cross their limits and reach a particular conclusion.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think arguments happen because of two main reasons. Firstly, people are unable to control<br>their emotions and they say things they wouldn’t normally. Secondly, they happen because<br>people have very strong opinions about something. So, I think instead of proving oneself right,<br>people should definitely try to listen to other’s point of view in arguments.</p><p><strong>5. If two people argue, do you think a third person should be involved in the settlement?<br></strong>I think the third person should not interfere in two person’s discussion. He should be involved only when the situation goes out of control or when someone requests a third person to help him/her.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, I think a third person can bring in the much needed objectivity because the people<br>involved in the argument become emotional about the issue. Sometimes a third person’s<br>involvement can bring a quick resolution, otherwise arguments can go on for days.</p><p><strong>6. Why do you think people are stubborn and unwilling to change?<br></strong>stubbornness means having or showing dogged/ purposeful determination not to change one’s attitude on something. especially in spite of good/ strong arguments or reasons to do so. Sometimes a person may be stubborn because they know that stubbornness helps them get what they want. Such kind people have a resolute adherence to their own ideas and opinions. Also. they have a strong resistance to change. especially when others want to change them.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think people are egoistic and they feel that they will lose if they listen to the other person.<br>Moreover, they come to believe or practice something because of their past experiences and<br>that’s why they are emotionally involved with the issue.</p><p><strong>7. Do you think you are stubborn?<br></strong>The word stubborn is not written in my dictionary. but I think One should be a little bit stubborn. Otherwise. they may lose many things which will never come back. I change myself according to the situation.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, I think it’s one of my big drawbacks. I have very strong opinions about certain things and<br>that’s why I am stubborn. However, I am trying to change this part about me and listen more<br>to others.</p><p><strong>8. Will you be willing to change?<br></strong>well. I change from time to time because it is good for us to keep updated. According to the situation and proper evidence.

Actually, I have a profound interest in singing right from my childhood. With god’s grace, very melodious voice and I love singing too much.</p><p><strong>When you discovered?<br></strong>I remember, when I was in 4th grade I got a chance to showcase my talent during school’s annual function. I sang a beautiful song on the stage and everyone appreciated my talent as well as my confidence. This thing gave me the motivation and my interest in singing further developed. Not only at school but I have publicly performed at family and community gatherings too.</p><p><strong>How you want to improve it?<br></strong>But, I believe need to improve this talent. For this, I am planning to join music classes in my city where I will not only learn how to sing better but also to play a musical instrument like a harmonium. For example, my friend Ravi is an exceptional singer and he also knows how to play the harmonium so he often practices singing while playing this instrument.</p><p>I too want to be a good singer like him and also play harmonium and guitar as it would make singing even more enjoyable for me. These days, I am learning to use an application which, helps in composing music on our own.</p><p><strong>And how you feel about it?<br></strong>It would be quite fascinating if I would compose my music and later upload videos on Youtube and other social networking applications which would help me to gain popularity in the field of music.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:<br></strong>Overall, it is one talent that would like to nourish.</p><p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>Well, I think that every person is born talented but the major thing Is to recognise that talent and fuse it with passion and smart work to get Successful.</p><p>By the grace of God, I’m a multitalented person who can do a lot of things like I’m a poet, a sportsperson and a quiet melodious singer as well. Although, till now I have never taken professional coaching for either of these, I’m really passionate about singing and would love to improve this talent.</p><p><strong>When you discovered?</strong><br>Actually, when I was a kid my mother always asked me to sing due to which my interest grew into it. After that, as I started going to school I participated in various singing competitions. Moreover, I got admission in one of the reputed Colleges because of this talent only as I used to sing in youth festivals.</p><p><strong>How you want to improve it?</strong><br>However, after completing college I got too engrossed in my work that never got a chance to polish my talent. But deep in my heart I’m really into singing and want to sharpen my skill.</p><p>Honestly, I don’t have that much time to join a professional trainer but I would rather prefer to purchase a musical instrument like a Guitar or Harmonium to continue my rehearsals.</p><p>The most important thing for singing in my view is stamina which can only be developed by joining the gym or doing physical activities at home like Bhangra, aerobics and So on.</p><p><strong>And how you feel about it?</strong><br>I really feel over the moon when Someone asks me to Sing and at last give compliments.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:<br></strong>So, this is a talent that I would love to improve.</p><h4><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 3 : Follow up Questions</strong></h4><p>Here some examples of follow up questions that you may asked during your speaking part 3 by examiner related to cue card “describe a natural talent you want to improve like sports music”.</p><p><strong>1. Do you think artists with talents should focus on their talents?<br></strong>I honestly think that artists with talents should focus on it only if they are passionate about it because If we are not passionate about something then we are not able to sustain our interest in the particular activity for long. For example, the son or daughter of a famous musician might have innate talent towards music but if they do not have any interest in music they will never become successful musicians.</p><p><strong>2. Is it possible for us to know the children who are 3 or 4 years old will become musicians or painters when they grow up?<br></strong>I do not think it is possible to predict what a child will grow up to be in the future at such a young age. Children at the age of 3 or 4 are very curious and show their interest in almost everything as they are discovering the world around them. It would be very difficult to identify that they will become an artist in the future or not, even if the child has some innate talent, as most of the parents do not pay much serious attention to what their child is doing.</p><p><strong>3. Do you think parents feel guilty for putting too much pressure on their children?<br></strong>Well, I believe parents do not feel much guilty for putting their children under pressure because they think that they are preparing their children for the challenges that the real world would bring in the future. Parents have the idea that putting their children under pressure will motivate them to push themselves harder and achieve the impossible in life.</p><p><strong>4. Why people like to watch talent shows?<br></strong>Honestly, I am not a big fan of talent shows but I think the primary reason why people love watching them is entertainment. The talent shows are full of entertainment which is based on reality as compared to the fictional dramas. People are able to relate a lot with these reality based shows and also they drive a lot of inspiration from such shows. The talent shows sometimes also show the struggling stories of the artists which a lot of people love to watch.</p><p><strong>5. Do you think it is more interesting to watch famous peoples or ordinary people’s show?<br></strong>Well, I have a mixed opinion for this question as both the categories teach us different things. From famous people, we get to know the story behind their struggles, hard work, and how they became successful, which is very motivating but then sometimes I feel that famous people are pretentious and one never gets to know how they are in real life. On the other hand, ordinary people offer us the real side of humanity to which everyone is able to relate in many different ways, be it emotionally or how people actually live. Since many people are able to relate with this so they find ordinary people more interesting.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a law on environmental protection.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a law on environmental protection.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What it is?<br>How you first learned about it?<br>Who benefits from it?<br>And explain how you feel about this law?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

You can make some notes to help you if you wish.</em></p><h4><strong>Model Answers and follow up questions to Describe a law on environmental protection IELTS cue card</strong></h4><p><strong>Model Answer 1:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:<br></strong>Well, the government of my country enacts various laws for the smooth functioning of the state.</p><p><strong>What it is?<br></strong>Here, I would like to talk about a very important law that has been introduced lately to protect the environment. It is quite unfortunate to see that the environment getting degraded day by day and if not taken seriously, it would lead to a dire consequence.</p><p>The biggest challenge at present is plastic waste. The amount of solid waste is constantly increasing and a major proportion of this waste is plastic. Millions of tons of plastic waste end up at landfill sites day In and day out. Since it is a non-biodegradable product it stays there forever. At the same time, it releases extremely harmful toxins and often become a cause of birds and animal’s death that feed on landfill sites.</p><p>To overcome this challenge, the government of India has completely banned the use of plastic bags. Now if people go shopping they carry their own bags usually Jute bags which are ecofriendly. Along with the ban, the government also aware the general public to say ‘No to plastic’. In fact, plastic is also responsible for ruining the beauty of public areas parks and bus stops.</p><p>Because plastic trash can be seen all around but under this law, if someone caught using plastic bags has to pay a five thousand rupees fine and the shopkeepers who keep plastic bags have to pay twenty thousand rupees fine. It is just because of this strict law and heavy penalty people have started avoiding plastic bags.</p><p><strong>Who benefits from it? </strong>and <strong>And explain how you feel about this law?<br></strong>It is resulting in a substantial decline in the amount of waste produced and keeping the environment clean and green.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:<br></strong>I hope there will be more laws that would be implemented to save the environment in future.</p><p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>Well, it is not wrong to say that global warming and the consequent 00 climate change are the direct outcomes of indiscriminate human activities. The increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the earth’s surface causing serious problems.</p><p>It is comforting to know that the nations around the world are giving priority to environmental issues due to which various acts have been introduced like the environment protection act, wildlife protection act, water prevention and control of pollution.</p><p><strong>What it is?</strong><br>But here I would like to talk about a major law that is to protect the trees. I got to know about this act from a newspaper that I like to read in the morning. According to this act, no one is allowed to cut the tree if it is not in their private land. Therefore, anyone found offending this rule will not only be fined but also sentenced to non-bailable jail for 2 years. It is well said that ‘when the last tree dies, last man dies’.</p><p>Honestly, it was really significant to make this law as it is clear that millions of trees are Chopped. As a result, the ratio of carbon dioxide has increased than Oxygen. Large areas of forest land, which maintains the balance of nature, are also destroyed in the name of industrialization and urbanisation. Consequently, large glaciers in the polar region melt, Creating flood and submerging vast areas of human-inhabited land Moreover, trees are the habitat of various birds And animals and the extinction of these can really be deleterious to mankind.</p><p><strong>And explain how you feel about this law?</strong><br>Preservation of trees is imperative to prolonged life on earth.</p><h4><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 3 : Follow up Questions</strong></h4><p>Here some examples of follow up questions that you may asked during your speaking part 3 by examiner related to cue card “Describe a law on environmental protection”.</p><p><strong>1. Do you think this law is acceptable to the people?<br></strong>Yes, I think this law has been accepted well by the people of India. There is growing awareness about the environmental issues and Indians too are making their efforts to save and preserve the<br>environment.</p><p><strong>2. Is there any situation wherein people may disobey the law?<br></strong>Yes, there are situations when people disobey the/this law. The main reasons for such laws not being followed by the people are personal profits/benefits and the convenience that they may have to give up.</p><p><strong>3. Do people like being a police officer in your country?<br></strong>Yes, many people in my country like being a police officer. Every year there are several people who take the tests to become a police officer. The competition that exists for such exams is a clear indicator that many people strive to become police officers and serve their country.</p><p><strong>3. What qualities should a police officer possess?<br></strong>A police officer should possess many qualities. He/she should be physically fit and active and should have a passion to serve the people and the Nation. Some other qualities are honesty, eagerness to search for the truth and bring justice to people, some skills like martial arts or other such combat skills to fight the criminals, courage, fearlessness, determination, and many more such qualities.</p><p><strong>4. Why some people prefer to be a lawyer?<br></strong>Some people prefer to be a lawyer because they want to ensure that everyone receives justice and is treated fairly by the law. They may have a desire to fight for others’ rights and ensure that everyone gets a fair chance to justify their actions. Some people choose this profession because of the prospects of earning money and fame.</p><p><strong>5. Should people be penalized when they use mobile phones while driving?<br></strong>These days vehicles are well equipped with a system wherein you can connect via bluetooth to your mobile and you can be handsfree and still use your mobile but if a driver is talking or texting on the phone while driving he should be heavily penalized.</p><p><strong>6. Is kindness the most important quality of a police officer?<br></strong>No, kindness is certainly not the best quality of a Police Officer. A Police officer has to be honest, straightforward, and very curious while performing his duty. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to be very kind as the criminals may take advantage of the situation</p><p><strong>7. Do you think both men and women can be police officers?<br></strong>These days we are living in an egalitarian society so gender bias doesn’t hold ground in any profession. Every man and every woman is worthy of any profession. So both and men and women are equally capable of serving in the police department</p><p><strong>8. Do you think the police officers are paid too much?<br></strong>I think in the Western world police officers are paid well in accordance to their duties but in the developing countries their salaries do not match the work they do, they deserve better salaries. But I do not agree that they are paid too much because they face too many dangers of life and limb while performing their services.</p><p><strong>9. Do all Indian people obey the law?<br></strong>Human psychology is the same everywhere in the world when the citizens know that they are going to be caught, penalized, put behind the bars, they will obey the law. A law well implemented is well obeyed. I think Indian people know they can find loopholes to save themselves, so they do not obey the law. I have come across very honest Indians and very dishonest people from other nations so the system that has to get strict.</p><p><strong>10. Are there laws about education in India?</strong></p><p><strong>11. What kind of rules do schools in India have?</strong></p><p><strong>12. What can teachers do to make students obey rules?</strong></p><p><strong>13.

It can be indoor or outdoor. Apart from playing, watching sports is also extreme entertainment, especially when it is live.</p><p>Honestly, I’m more into playing rather than watching. My favourite game Is football and I’m a die-hard fan of Messi. I’ve seen his performance in numerous live matches that telecast on TV.</p><p><strong>What it was? </strong>and <strong>When you watched it?<br></strong>But here I would like to talk about a football match which was organised last year by our local council to encourage more youngsters to play. Actually, I was a part of the team yet I was not able to play that match due to an injury.</p><p><strong>What it was like?<br></strong>Therefore, I watched it sitting in the stands. The experience was really unbeatable. As it was like riding a roller coaster. There was so much energy in the crowd, people were shouting to cheer up their players.

Do you prefer to watch live sports or watch it on TV?<br></strong>I prefer watching sports on the TV. I think the Televisions have improved so much over the recent<br>times that the experience is the same as watching it live. Moreover, the luxury of sitting in the comfort of one’s house cannot be matched.</p><p><strong>2. Why do some people like to watch live sports?<br></strong>I think watching sports live is much more about spending quality time with friends and family. People go there to break the monotony of everyday life and do something different. For some, it is also about the possibility of meeting or getting an autograph from their favourite sportsperson.</p><p><strong>3. What kind of sports do Indian people like to watch?<br></strong>Indians are crazy about many sports like hockey, football, but I think nothing can come close to the popularity of cricket. I think nearly everyone watches cricket and many play it also. In fact, many Indians in foreign countries also play cricket even though the game isn’t popular there.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think competition is good for students?<br></strong>Certainly, I think competition makes us students work harder. Life without competition would be very boring. Moreover, the growing population means that competition is only going to increase in the future, so it better for students to learn to handle competition from early childhood.</p>"},{"title":"Describe an article on health you read in a magazine or on the internet IELTS cue card","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an article on health you read in a magazine or on the internet<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What it was?<br>Where you read it?<br>Why you read it?<br>And how you felt about it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

For example, I have take classes of driving, music as well as French some time ago.</p><p><strong>What it is about?<br></strong>But now I am planning to take cooking classes that I think I would need in near future. There are quite a few reasons why I want to opt for this course.</p><p><strong>Why you made this plan?<br></strong>The fact is that I am planning to move to Canada for my higher study very soon. Obviously, there would be no one to cook for me. For that reason, I really need to learn how to cook food so that I can survive in that new country. This way, I would be able to save myself from eating outside food all the time.</p><p>As many of my friends are already in Canada and do not know how to cook food, they have to buy outside food which is certainly not only unhealthy but very expensive also.

So, if I know how to cook food I can easily find a job in a restaurant.</p><p><strong>What you need to do first?<br></strong>Well, soon I will be having holidays and during this time I am going to take the help of my mother in learning this skill.

Do you think it is important for a person to have a career plan?<br></strong>Yes, it is very important for a person to have a career plan. A career plan gives a person something to look forward to. He can then plan his education according to that career plan.<br>Without a plan, any work seems meaningless. So, it is very important to have a plan. Sometimes, a person may change his plan midway, but all the same without a plan taking any<br>step ahead is impossible.</p><p><strong>2. How do most people plan their future education and their future career?<br></strong>Most people plan their future education and career by talking to their parents, teachers, career counsellors and by consulting some people who are already in the same career.</p><p><strong>3. Do you think it’s important to include the factor of one’s salary in a career plan?<br></strong>Yes, salary is a very important factor in a career plan. It is generally seen that in the early stages of one’s life, money is needed for everything. One cannot go for a career, which doesn’t pay well in the early stages. Later on in life, one can go for a career, which one loves even if it doesn’t pay well.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think planning is important or is it a waste of time?<br></strong>Planning is very important. It is definitely not a waste of time. If things are done without<br>planning, then it wastes a lot of time because most of the effort may go in the wrong direction and prove futile.</p><p><strong>5. What kinds of personal plans should people make for themselves?<br></strong>People should make plans about their studies, about their careers, their finances, about their married life, about places they want to visit, and about their retirement.</p><p><strong>6. In general, how do people make plans?<br></strong>People make plans according to their situation, by consulting their elders and also by realizing their own interests and hobbies.</p><p><strong>7. For a person with children, what influence does this have on their personal plans for the<br>future?</strong><br>When a person has children, all his personal plans take a backseat, and the upbringing of the<br>child comes first. All the personal plans become flexible and revolve around the needs of the family and children. I think this flexibility has a charm of its own.</p><p><strong>8. Should parents set goals for children?<br></strong>Parents are the best people to set goals for the children. They can help their children in setting<br>goals. They know the temperament of their child and so it is all right if they set goals for them,<br>but at the same time, they should keep in mind the aptitude of the child and set realistic goals for him/her.</p><p><strong>9. When do young children start to set goals for themselves?<br></strong>Children start to set goals for themselves after completing senior secondary when they have<br>to decide which college to join. But these goals are mainly in consultation with their parents.<br>Once they start earning they start setting goals independently.</p>"},{"title":"Describe an occasion when you were not allowed to use your mobile phone.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an occasion when you were not allowed to use your mobile phone<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>When it was?<br>Where it was?<br>Why you were not allowed to use your mobile phone?<br>How you felt about it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Due to cell phones we have instant access to information and also because of them we can connect with our loved ones anywhere, anytime. But at the same time if you think about the negative impacts cell phones have also become a great cause of stress in our lives. The need to always stay connected is taking a toll on our personal lives.</p><p><strong>2.

It would be a wonderful place for old people to sit together to play cards, gossip and enjoy other activities. Similarly, it would also provide a safe playing area for children. In my area, most children play on the streets which are quite dangerous as there is always a risk of accidents.</p><p>But, a park would offer them a safer place, where they can play. In fact, as per the news, the new park would have swings and rides to allure them.

Do people read newspaper where you live?<br></strong>Yes, people in my city love to read the newspaper. In fact, there are so many people in my society who read almost 2-3 newspapers every day. I guess the reason behind it is that the literacy rate in my city is one of the highest in my country. So, the educated people love to read newspaper so that they have some content to discuss with their colleagues or neighbours. Also, there is a newspaper publishing company in my city which is also the largest selling English daily in North India.</p><p><strong>2. Do people prefer local or international news?<br></strong>I think there are lot of factors which decide whether a person would read local or international news. For example, because of Covid everyone is equally interested in both international as well as local news. People know about the development of vaccine and they also want to know about the number of Covid cases in their city. At the same time, if we leave Covid aside, then we can say that small businessmen or people from weak economic backgrounds are mostly interested in local news whereas those who are working for multi-national companies are more interested in international news.</p><p><strong>3. Do you think it’s important to have a national identity?<br></strong>Yes, I think it’s very important to have a national identity because it encourages people to understand the country they live in and work for the betterment of their country. Also, for countries which have gained independence, it helps the people to realize the sacrifices made by their ancestors and it teaches them to uphold those values.</p><p><strong>4. How can people develop their national identity?<br></strong>I think there are many ways in which people could develop their national identity. The first and easiest way would be to wear the traditional attires of their country. Secondly, they can wear pins of their flags or hoist the national flags outside their country. In my country the government has installed huge National flags in majority of the city centres and also they have established a law according to which our national anthem is played in the movie theatre before the screening of any movie.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a tall building in your city you like or dislike.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a tall building in your city you like or dislike<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Where it is?<br>What it is used for?<br>What it looks like?<br>And explain why you like or dislike it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of living in tall buildings<br></strong>I think the main advantage of living in tall buildings is better daylighting and air ventilation. It also offers a great view of city life. Finally, the upper floors are free from the noise of the streets below. On the other hand, the main drawback is the risk of disasters like fires and falling down due to earthquakes. Another thing I dislike is that it is a lot more time taking to enter or leave the apartments.</p><p><strong>2. Do you think there will be more tall buildings in the future?<br></strong>Yes definitely, as the land is becoming scarce especially in big cities. I think in the future it would be a luxury to live in single-storey or double storey houses and tall buildings would be commonplace. I3L TS makk AR</p><p><strong>3. Why aren’t there many tall buildings in the countryside?<br></strong>The simple reason is the availability of land. As there is a lot of vacant land available in countryside regions, tall buildings don’t make sense. Moreover, people in the countryside are accustomed to spending times in open spaces and even if tall apartments are built in such areas, I don’t think people would prefer living in them.</p><p><strong>4. Why do some people like to live in tall buildings nowadays?<br></strong>I think the main reason is that they are cheaper. Especially in bigger cities, the land is so costly that it is impossible for even the affluent to afford single storey or double storey houses. Moreover, tall buildings offer certain respite from the noise from the streets below.</p>"},{"title":"Describe an occasion when many people were smiling.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an occasion when many people were smiling.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>When it happened?<br>Who you were with?<br>What happened?<br>And explain why many people were smiling?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Is it easy to find a job in India?<br></strong>In this competitive era, it is tough to find a job in India and other countries. People do their best to get the job which increases the level of competition.<br><br>No, definitely not easy. India is a diverse country and has a population of more than 120 crores. Obviously, there is a lot of competition in getting jobs.</p><p><strong>2. What should the government do if there is unemployment?<br></strong>well, no work is big or small so government should encourage people to accept the small job if someone offered them and try to give the best performance to achieve higher position. Moreover, the government should motivate people to do self-employment.<br><br>The government should encourage self-employment and also set up cottage industries, so that more and more people can be employed. MNCs should also be encouraged, so that the<br>problem of unemployment can be mitigated.</p><p><strong>3. Is a high salary important?<br></strong>It varies from person to person. Some people accept the job because of its higher pay scale; it doesn’t matter whether they are interested in the job. On the other hand, some people are passionate about their work they want satisfaction, so they accept those jobs they want to do, it is ok if they receive a low salary.<br><br>Yes, a high salary is very important. Money is of course the most important motivation to work. But sometimes, it is OK to get a job one loves, even if the salary is a bit less.</p><p><strong>4. Is it ok to do a job you like with a low salary?<br></strong>As I said earlier, it depends on the situation and person. Some people accept lower-salary jobs because they want satisfaction. On the other hand fresher’s won’t experience, so they get lower salary job in the starting of their career.<br><br>If I have to choose a job with a slightly high salary, but I don’t like it, then I wouldn’t do it and choose the job of my liking. However, if the difference in pay is very high, then I would go for that job even if I don’t like it much.</p><p><strong>5. Are there many big companies in your country?<br></strong>Yes, there are many big companies in India, and some are establishing in the coming time. India is a developing nation, so developed country’s companies launch branch in developing nations.<br><br>Yes, there are. India is a fast developing country. There are many Indian companies, which are very big such as Tata, Mahindra, Godrej, Reliance, Onida, and so on. There are also many multinational giants which have opened branches in India, such as Samsung, LG, Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, and so on.</p><p><strong>6. How can a small company grow big?<br></strong>Many things are required to make a small organization big such as men’s power, good strategies, offer excellent customer services, use social media, and, most importantly, money.<br><br>Small companies can do so in many ways. They can work hard, employ skilled workers, focus on quality, and employ good marketing strategies.</p><p><strong>7.

Moreover, the company will receive charitable activities, and you will also gain numerous social benefits when you give back.<br><br>Yes, they should. I believe that anyone who has enough should help the needy on humanitarian grounds. Many big companies help NGOs and NPOs. This is a win-win situation for both.

Karan is my school friend. He is my best buddy and I have spent a lot of time with him. He is a super-intelligent student and he has helped me in my studies throughout my school days.</p><p>I vividly remember, when we were in 8th grade and our final exam was just around the corner. We all received a notice from our school management to deposit the outstanding fee prior to the final exam. Else they would not allow the students to sit in the examination hall. The time when my friend read this notice, he really got disappointed when I enquired why he is so sad and disappointed.</p><p>He told me that he has no money to pay the school fee. the fact is that is from a very poor family and somehow his parents manage his school fee but at that time his mother was really sick and was hospitalised for that reason most of the earnings were going her medication, to hear this I really got emotional because I did not want to see my friend sad and not being able to take the final exams just because of not paying the school fee in time.</p><p><strong>How you helped him/her?<br></strong>The time I went home, I broke my piggy bank. whatever the money was there, I collected and I decided that I help my friend. In fact, requested my parents as well to give me a pocket allowance in advance. I procured enough money and the next day, I went to the school office and pay the school fee for my friend.</p><p><strong>Why you helped him/her? And how you felt about it?<br></strong>The time he got to know that I had paid his school fee. He just came and hugged me tightly and kept on thanking me again and again but I requested him to stop saying thank you because it just because of our friendship I did this I did not do any kind of favour to you.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:<br></strong>But, just because you are my friends I wanted to help and this how I help my friend who was in dire need at that time.</p><p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><ul><li>Helping others is a very good thing.</li><li>I have given and received help many times.</li></ul><p><strong>When it was?</strong></p><ul><li>Here, I would like to talk about a situation, when I helped my friend in studies.</li><li>When I was in 10th, my friend Rahul suffered a sprain in his ankle while playing hockey in the school.</li><li>He was advised strict bed rest for three weeks.</li></ul><p><strong>Why you helped him/her?</strong></p><ul><li>Our exams were very near and Rahul’s mother was very worried that he would fail this time if he did not attend school.</li><li>So, I decided to help him as much as I could.</li></ul><p><strong>How you helped him/her?</strong></p><ul><li>Every day after school, I would go to his house and update him with everything that was done in school.</li><li>His mother was so happy with my efforts that she would prepare nice shakes or something to eat for me every day.</li><li>Perhaps, that was her way of thanking me.</li><li>I used to reach home very late, but when I told my parents the reason, they were OK with it.</li><li>Then the exams came, and Rahul and I both scored above 80% marks.</li></ul><p><strong>And how you felt about it?</strong></p><ul><li>I realised that in helping him, I had helped myself even more.

How do people usually help each other?<br></strong>People help each other in many ways. For example, people help tourists by telling them about<br>directions. People also help each other financially by loaning some money during tough times.<br>In student life, intelligent students help others with their homework or studies during after<br>school hours.</p><p><strong>2. How is online help different from real-life help?<br></strong>The main way people can help others online is by bringing attention of others to their ordeal. For example, many people got hold of oxygen during covid pandemic by raising SOS calls on the internet. People can also donate money to charities online, which can use them on the ground. I think the biggest difference is that we cannot directly help others online except if we transfer them money. However, the advantage is that people can help others online wherever they are located and they are not restricted by their geographical boundaries.</p><p><strong>3. Should schools be responsible for teaching students how to cooperate?<br></strong>I think both schools and parents should be responsible for teaching children about cooperation. However, the increasing competition in schools is sadly having an opposite effect and many students are facing issues in working along with others in their adult life.</p><p><strong>4. What are the differences between help from friends and help from family?<br></strong>I think the main difference is that in case of help from friends we feel more obligated to return it sooner or later, whereas in the cases of family we don’t feel that need. We take help from family for granted, which is both a good thing and a bad thing.</p><p><strong>5. Do you like helping others?<br></strong>Yes, I do. I love helping others. I have realised it gives a lot of mental satisfaction and happiness.</p><p><strong>6. Should parents teach helping others to their children?<br></strong>Yes, of course. Parents are responsible for bringing their children into this world, and so it is their duty to make their children into responsible citizens of the future. Parents don’t have to do anything special to accomplish this. They just have to lead by example. Children will automatically follow their footsteps. If all citizens are helpful and nice, then the whole world would become a nice place to live in.</p><p><strong>7. Do you think nowadays people do more good work as compared to the past?<br></strong>I don’t think so. Life in the past was simpler and slower. People helped each other a lot. Now, everyone is in the rat race of money and materialism. No one has the time to help others.</p><p><strong>8. Will you help others in the future?<br></strong>Yes, definitely. I believe that we must do unto others as we want them to do unto us. If I will help others, only then I can expect help from others when I need it.</p><p><strong>9. How do you encourage children to help others?<br></strong>Nothing special is needed. Children are good observers and copy what their elders are doing. All you have to do is help others and they will automatically follow.</p><p><strong>10. How do world social organizations such as Red Cross collect their funds worldwide?<br></strong>They do so by advertising their work. They organise activities and involve young people in them. They also take the help of media.</p><p><strong>11. Do small non-government organizations always need big organizations’ help or can they collect funds themselves?<br></strong>No, they do not always need big organisations help. If their projects are small, they can manage on their own, otherwise they can seek the help of their bigger counterparts.</p><p><strong>12. Do you think people in India should help foreigners who are visiting India and who need help?(Why? / Why not?)<br></strong>Definitely, yes. India is known for its hospitality and helpful nature. Guests are treated like Gods. Tourists are our guests. If tourists need help, they should be helped. They will take back happy memories and more and more tourists will flock-in in the future.</p><p><strong>13. What is the most important way for a country to help foreigners who are visiting the country?<br></strong>Foreigners can be helped by guiding them about our customs and traditions, so that they do not unknowingly hurt anybody’s sentiments. They can be helped by providing them good and hygienic food, which suits their taste. They can be helped by not fleecing them when they buy some souvenirs.</p><p><strong>14. Many people only look out for themselves and never think about helping others. What do you think of this attitude?<br></strong>I think such people are very short sighted. They do not think that if they don’t help others they will also be left alone when they need help.</p><p>Describe a time when you helped a friend IELTS cue cardYes, Indian people help others who are in extreme poverty. Some help directly and some help through charity organisations.</p>"},{"title":"Describe your favorite movie.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe your favorite movie.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>When and where you saw it?<br>What type of film it was?<br>What the film was about?<br>And explain why it is your favourite film?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

By watching English films one can develop one’s English language.</p><p><strong>2. In what ways are documentary films and films only for entertainment different?<br></strong>Feature films are mainly made to entertain the audience, whereas documentaries are meant to inform, to confront people with reality, and sometimes to promote a point of view.

Documentaries are usually low budget, whereas feature films can cost crores.</p><p><strong>3.

Do you like to share?<br></strong>Well, sharing is a good habit. I also like to share my things such as notes, clothes and electronic equipment with my friends and cousins.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, I love to share. In fact, I shared my meals with all my friends at school. I also used to share my notes with my friends and classmates. It was a habit.</p><p><strong>2. What are the consequences if children don’t like to share?<br></strong>it is very beneficial if a person shares things with others because, as a result, other people also help them. Children should have this kind of habit because it is beneficial for their future, but if children do not like to share, they might face many problems when they have grown up and work in a company. During work, employees have to do a lot of teamwork where they have to share many things, so if they are not ready to share something, they might face many problems.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think it might be difficult for children to make new friends if they are hesitant to share. When children grow up, they might face even bigger problems. For example, when they are working in a company and they are asked to share their responsibilities with others. If they fail to do so, they might even lose their jobs.</p><p><strong>3. How do you feel about sharing accommodations with others on campus?<br></strong>Sharing accommodation with others on campus not only allows us to meet new people and make new friends, but social networks booms also. I think privacy is also essential. I can share accommodation but do not share a room with others. I can share my room with others only when the person has the same mindset.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I am open to sharing a house with others but I am not open to sharing my room. Also, in the case of house, it would depend upon the person I have to share the accommodation with. I would love to share accommodation with people with the same mindset.</p><p><strong>4. How could parents and teachers teach young children to share?<br></strong>It is a well-known fact that children always copy their elders or can say they follow their elder’s footsteps. So if their parents and teachers share things with others, then children will like to share their things, and there is no need to give them extra lessons.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think parents could do this by actually making children share responsibilities and things at home. For example, young children should be made to share a room. Teachers can give group assignments and encourage children to work together. When they work together and depend upon each other, they would automatically learn to share.</p><p><strong>5. Do people in your country (or, you) prefer to share public transport or do they (you) prefer to use private transport?<br></strong>It depends on various things such as financial status, time and destination. If people have enough time, they use public transport, which helps them save their money. On the other hand, some people are very introvert and like to travel alone and use private transport. Moreover, financially weak people share public transport.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Well, it depends on the financial status of the people. Those who can afford, like to use their own private transport. Others prefer public transport. It also depends on the availability and comfort of public transport. Ever since the AC buses have improved their frequency to Chandigarh, I prefer to travel on those than going by my car.</p><p><strong>6. Do many people in your country share their home with others or do they mostly live alone?<br></strong>Nowadays most of the people move to cities from villages for their better future. Some buy their own house, but some live in the rented house but do not share their home with others. They share their house only with their relatives, friends but sometimes.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Most people live in their own home or live in a rented house.

Why do people like to keep pets?</strong><br>Spending time with pets is the best way to reduce stress and anxiety levels. Several studies/researches have revealed that people who tend to spend their time with pets are more likely to live longer than people who don’t. That’s the way they like to keep pets</p><p><strong>2. What should we do to protect endangered animals?</strong><br>This kind of work required many funds to donate some money to NGO to protect endangered animals. We can educate our society and family about endangered species. Moreover, we can motivate people to keep the environment clean and try to use a recyclable product.</p><p><strong>3. Do you support doing experiments on animals?</strong><br>Even though Animal models help ensure the effectiveness and safety of the new treatment, animals suffer a lot of pain and other types of infection, so I do not support animal experiments.</p><p><strong>4. Why do some people refuse to eat animals?</strong><br>There are many reasons people refuse to eat animals such as some people are pure vegetarian, so they do not eat animals, another reason is religion, in India, people worship animals such as cow, so that’s why they don’t eat animals. Moreover, non-vegetarian food contains lots of fat, so people who are health conscious do not eat animals.</p><p><strong>5. What would happen when some species disappear on earth?</strong><br>There can be many negative consequences if some species become extinct on our planet. The first effect is that there will be an imbalance in the ecosystem.

Do you think we should tell the truth at all times?</strong><br>I don’t think telling the truth at all times is a wise choice. I think if the truth does nothing but hurt a person, I think we should avoid telling the truth.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Honestly speaking, the fact will earn your respect because it shows you care for others, but we cannot tell the truth all the time. Sometimes the truth may hurt the feelings. It doesn’t mean that you told lies to others; in fact, you can hide the truth for sometimes and speak it later.</p><p><strong>2. How do you know when others are telling the truth?</strong><br>I think it is easy to tell how others are telling the truth from their facial expressions. For example, people start sweating or avoiding eye contact when they are lying. However, this might also be sweating due to other reasons, and thus, it is not easy to determine if people are indeed lying or just physically uncomfortable.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>The signs of honesty, which we’ll get to, are a combination of both verbal and non-verbal cues. When someone tells you a lengthy, complete and detailed story, they are likely telling the truth. Moreover, it is tough for a person to hold eye contact if he/she is speaking lie but a while speaking the truth, it is effortless. In addition to this , those who are telling the truth also tend to have a steady speaking voice. Liars tend to use negative outside forces as excuses truth-tellers are less likely to do so.</p><p><strong>3. Do you think it is important to win the game or follow the rules?</strong><br>I think the victory would feel hollow if people do not follow the rules. It would not feel that the victory was deserved. So, although the outcome is important, following the rules is even more important.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Children learn that they can win without cheating if they are winning by following the rules. Participating in competitions at school or the playground can help parents teach their kids about the importance of teamwork, commitment to a task, cooperation and respect for the opponent. So, I think to follow the rules are as necessary as winning is essential.</p><p><strong>4. Sometimes, people should tell lies. Do you agree?</strong><br>Yes, I believe that if the truth serves no purpose but only hurts other people’s feelings, we should avoid telling the truth. For example, telling a person just before a party they don’t look good in the dress would make them uncomfortable and reduce their confidence.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, I agree with that, sometimes people should tell lies. It is good, to be honest, but it may create problems if a person speaks the truth because it hurts others’ feelings. But it doesn’t mean that speak lies all the time, a person should talk about the fact only when the situations are satiable for it.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a skill that you can teach other people","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a skill that you can teach other people.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What is it?<br>How you learnt it?<br>How can you teach others this skill?<br>How do you feel about this skill?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

However, there is one skill that I know well, and I am able to teach others. That is the ‘mindful breathing skill.’ Mindful breathing is a very basic yet powerful meditation technique. The idea is to simply focus your attention on your breathing, to its natural rhythm and flow and the way it feels on inhaling and exhaling. This skill is becoming more and more popular due to its countless advantages. </p><p><strong>How you learnt it?</strong><br>I learned this skill two years ago, in my practical yoga class from my yoga teacher. The purpose of this skill is to concentrate on the present moment so that we can let go of worrying about the past and the future. Such breathing technique reduces anxiety, helps with pain reduction, manages stressful thoughts, and decreases negative thinking. It is a useful, powerful, and life-changing skill. </p><p><strong>How can you teach others this skill?</strong><br>I can teach this skill personally by demonstrating to a small group about the different ways of mindful breathing. I do not need any equipment for it. I can teach this in a garden or in a classroom. It is also possible to teach this skill online. I have also made my videos to teach this skill to my friends who are away, and I can’t meet them. I can teach practical as well as explain the theoretical benefits of mindful breathing. I have taught this to many. </p><p><strong>How do you feel about this skill?</strong><br>Whenever I practice this skill myself, I feel relaxed and rejuvenated. I have learnt to let go and forgive others. My faith in God is reassured, and I feel positive and happier than before. I feel that I should teach this skill to as many people as I know so that more people can get benefits of this skill as well. I also believe that this skill should be taught in school so that children can learn to manage their tensions and tough emotions. I feel lucky that I know this skill.  </p><p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> <br>Well, there are ample skills that I have learnt in my life, from which some are driving, swimming, cooking. I opine that these skills are really in need of an hour. As nowadays youth has to travel long distance either to study or in search of jobs. Therefore, it becomes mandatory for an individual to know their skills as essential for survival and make a person independent. </p><p><strong>What is it? </strong><br>One skill that I would love to teach is cooking. The first reason behind it is that lam a foodie, and I enjoy having and cooking different cuisines. </p><p><strong>How did you learn it?</strong><br>I learned this skill from various sources, but the basics were definitely explained to me by my mother as she has excellent culinary skills. </p><p><strong>How can you teach others this skill?</strong> <br>Honestly, currently, I do not have any such plans to teach to others, but if I do in the future, then I would have numerous platforms due to the advancement of technology, and I think Youtube will be my choice as it has the vast audience and I can come in contact with more people in less time. </p><p><strong>How do you feel about this skill?</strong> <br>Most importantly, it also provides a chance to earn, which is, I think, a great advantage. Moreover, its a fact that to establish anything new, finances play a vital role, whereas hearing a person just needs a smartphone to shoot and upload the video. </p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br>So, this is a skill that I can teach to others. </p><p><strong><strong>Model Answer 3:</strong></strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><ul><li>Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences.</li><li>A teacher is a person who helps students to acquire knowledge, competence</li></ul><p><strong>What is it?

Should teachers be funny when they teach?</strong> <br>Humour is a universal communication phenomenon, and people tend to seek others who make them laugh. However, the classroom is not typically associated/ has no relation with laughter or humorous interaction. Education has always traditionally been thought of as a serious undertaking, but if a teacher has a good sense of humour and friendly nature, it can improve the relationship of a teacher with their student. Students can share their problems without any hesitation. But more friendly nature may disturb the class discipline.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>Yes, I think teachers should employ the use of humour while teaching. It lightens the class atmosphere and improves the relationship between students and teachers. In other words, students feel comfortable discussing their doubts and problems with the teachers. However, teachers must learn when to be strict; otherwise, it can impact classroom discipline.</p><p><strong>2. What qualities should teachers have?</strong><br>A teacher can make a world of difference in a student’s life, that impacting everything means from their classroom learning to their long term success. Good teachers are strong communicators. By effective communication, a teacher can explain a subject very well. A teacher should be a good listener The teacher should understand and listen to the student’s problem before giving any decision. Good teachers should be adaptable means; they have the quality to adjust in any environment.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Firstly, I think the most important skill that teachers should have is good communication skills. They need to understand how to teach in simple words. Secondly, they should be good observers. They need to be able to pick up the fears and anxieties students have. Only then they can build their confidence. Finally, teaching is about patience. Teachers need to be ready to explain the concepts repeatedly if their students are facing any difficulty.</p><p><strong>3. Which do you think are more important practical skills or academic skills?</strong><br>I think they are dependent on each other. If we have theoretical knowledge, then we can easily do it practically. But if we know or learn only one skill, then our study is incomplete.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Practical skills and academic skills have their own importance. I think it depends upon the person’s profession. If a person wants to be a teacher, a lawyer, or anything in academics, they need to be an expert in academics. However, in other fields like business, communication skills etcetera, are more important.</p><p><strong>4. Which age group is the best age for learning?</strong><br>According to my perception, a person can learn new thing at any age because it makes the mind more active and up to date. For example, nowadays we use many new technological equipment types daily compared to past, so elders must learn new techniques because new methods make their work easy and save time. Another fact is that child age is the best age to learn new things.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I am a strong believer in the fact that there is no age for learning. We can learn anything at any age. And actually, I believe that we should keep learning new skills as it keeps the mind sharp and active.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a time when you needed to use your imagination","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a time when you needed to use your imagination.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>When was it?<br>When did you need to use imagination?<br>How difficult or easy it was?<br>Explain how you felt about it.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

It is considered as such because it involves thinking about possibilities(a thing that may happen or be the case). </p><p><strong>Model Answer</strong> <strong>1</strong>:</p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>Well, it is very important to make use of our sense of imagination as it reflects our intelligence as well as creativity. I often make use of this power and now I would like to talk about a time. when I drew painting using imagination. Right from my school days, I have a deep interest towards art and I have taken part in many painting competition at school level.</p><p><strong>When it was?</strong><br>I vividly remember, when I was in 8th grade 410110 and I fall seriously sick.j61 was not attending school for a while and during this time my school organized a painting competition I was completely unawared about the date of this contest and I had no preparation:. at all. The day after recovering I went to school.</p><p><strong>When you needed to use imagination?</strong><br>I got to know that the painting competition is going to happen today. My all friends why were taking part in this competition were quite confident as they were prepared a they were saying that this time we are go to beat you because who are not prepared for this contest at all.</p><p><strong>How difficult or easy it was?</strong><br>Well, rather then getting nervous I decided that I will come up something in my mind and I will make a painting. So the completion started and all the painters had to come up with a painting in one hour time. Now this point, I decided I will make a painting of Golden Temple using my imagination.</p><p><strong>Explain how you felt about it</strong>?<br>It’s a beautiful building and I had visited this place few number of times so, I was quite aware how it looks like. So, now I started painting as I was visualizing. For example, the sanctum sanctorum the holy pond and  two other things. At the Same time, I painted it with realistic colours. For example, I choose golden for the prime structure and blue to represent the water in the pond.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>In one hour, I completed and it was looking  stunning. My teachers really appreciated me not only the painting but, my sense of imagination that really helped me to draw this wonderful piece of art. Since, it was best among all. So, I was also honored by my teacher with a reward</p><p><strong>Model Answer 2</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><ul><li>There are many situations when ingenuity has helped me tackle difficult situations.</li></ul><p><strong>When was it?</strong></p><ul><li>A few months, I had gone to Jammu for an examination.</li><li>But, because of the fog, my train back home got cancelled.</li><li>So, I decided to travel back by bus.</li><li>The bus dropped me at my city’s bus station at about 2 AM.</li><li>I told my parents that I would be coming by bus, but because I had left my flashlight on, my phone battery had died on my phone.</li><li>So, I couldn’t call my parents to pick me up when I reached the bus station.</li><li>And because of the fog, my parents couldn’t estimate when the bus would reach my home city.</li><li>So, I was forced to walk back alone at night.</li></ul><p><strong>When did you need to use imagination?</strong></p><ul><li>At this time, I saw some strangers walking towards me.</li><li>I felt that their intentions were not right, and I was anxious.</li></ul><p><strong>How difficult or easy it was?</strong></p><ul><li>At that moment, I used my imagination and took out the phone and started talking loudly on the phone.</li><li>I knew that my phone was dead, but they didn’t know that the phone was dead.</li><li>As they came closer, I started saying that I am just around the corner.</li><li>As they heard this, they moved back, and I used this opportunity to run a nearby 24/7 store.</li></ul><p><strong>Explain how you felt about it.</strong></p><ul><li>Once inside, I borrowed the phone from the sales clerk and called my parents to pick me up.</li><li>The whole time my heart was beating very loudly.</li><li>It was a terrifying situation.</li><li>On seeing my father and mother, I finally took a huge sigh of relief.</li><li>My father told me that he was really proud of my presence of mind, and a lot of people told me that they wouldn’t have been able to think on their feet as I did.</li></ul><h4><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 3 : Follow up Questions</strong></h4><p>Here some examples of follow up questions that you may asked during your speaking part 3 by examiner related to cue card “describe a time when you needed to use your imagination”.</p><p><strong>1. Do you think adults can have lots of imagination?</strong><br>I think imagination depends on age. The child age is best for creativity because they are free from responsibilities and tensions, so they imagine many things; sometimes, they imagine those things which are not possible in reality. They do so because they don’t have a sense of what is right or wrong. I also think that adults can imagine correctly and create only those stories possible in reality, but another fact is that due to workload and stress, their imagination power is low compared to children.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>I don’t think imagination depends upon age. Both children and adults can imagine things. The only thing is that children are not restricted by real-world knowledge in their imagination. So, children can sometimes imagine completely impossible things.</p><p><strong>2. Do you think imagination is necessary for scientists?</strong><br>yes, imagination is essential for scientists because they start their research on those concepts they imagined. Through vision only, we have reached Mars and plan to build a successful time machine. Imagination can only help us to understand nature and her mysteries. Without imagination, science would never have existed.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>I think all scientific discoveries are about looking at something from a new or different perspective. So, imagination is certainly important for scientists. Many would have seen an apple fall from a tree before Newton, but he was the first one to relate it to a force.</p><p><strong>3. What kind of jobs need imagination?</strong><br>Well, every job need imagination for example while painting an artist have to create a picture in mind before the draw on the paper, in the science field, to start any research a scientist imagine an idea and its possible outcomes. Moreover, in the film industry, before making the film a director has to create a picture in an actor’s mind and make sure that he/she easily understand the story.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>I think the biggest field with needs imagination is science. Then, another field in which I think is being a fantasy author. A fantasy author basically puts down his imagination on a piece of paper. I think some of the famous fantasy authors like Tolkien or JK Rowling are some of the people with an endless imagination.</p><p><strong>4. What subjects are helpful for people’s imagination?</strong><br>Imagination comes naturally in children, but it’s a habit of mind that needs to be taught and reinforced throughout life: “Young human beings need exercises in imagination as they need practice in all the necessary skills of life. I think literature, investigation stories, adventurous moves are helpful for people’s imagination.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>I think literature can be very helpful to develop imagination. I remember reading Alice in Wonderland was so exciting. It was my first time reading a fantasy novel, and I just couldn’t put it down. After reading each chapter, I used to think about what would happen next, and that in turn, was nothing but exercising my imagination.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a special hotel you stayed in","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a special hotel you stayed in.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Where is it?<br>Why you went there?<br>What is it like?<br>Explain how you felt about it.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Do the ratings of people influence their choice?</strong><br>Yes, nowadays people check the rating and reviews of the hotel before reserving any room. People who already visited the hotel can define better than the hotel management because people define the positive and negative points about the place, but management always represents good points of the place.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, I think most people look at hotel ratings before making a reservation. I believe it is very difficult to judge how the stay experience would be just by looking at the hotel and room pictures.</p><p><strong>2. How do people reserve rooms?</strong><br>Nowadays, many online websites are available through which people reserve their rooms. In addition to this, people who are not friendly with the internet use the telephone to reserve the hotel room or book a room when they visit the place.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think people make reservations through internet websites like Goair, Ibibo, Trivago, Oyo etcetera. Some people also make reservations through the telephone.</p><p><strong>3. What influences people’s choice of hotels?</strong><br>Many factors influence people’s choice of hotel. First and the foremost is, place, means people prefer to select those near railway stations, bus stand, or airport. Second is the transport facility. Moreover, people also check online reviews about the place. Last but essential factor is the price and other facilities such as AC, TV wife.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think many factors influence people’s choices. The two main factors are the price of the rooms and the amenities available like air conditioning, TV, locker and so on. Internet ratings and reviews are also a major consideration nowadays.</p><p><strong>4. What’s the difference between hotels in your country and hotels abroad?</strong><br>I think there no significant difference in hotels nowadays. All national and international hotels provide similar facilities to all. There is only one difference that is, building design, hotels that are in the hill station and snowy area look different from the hotel that is in plain areas.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>I don’t think there is any particular difference in hotels. Today, there are hotels from chains like Taj, Hilton, Marriot all over the world. The design may vary depending upon the location, for example, beaches, hillsides etcetera. But as India has all these types of locations, nearly all types of hotels are available here.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a person who wears unusual clothes","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a person who wears unusual clothes.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Who is he/she?<br>How do you know him/her?<br>What kind of clothes he/she wears?<br>Why do you consider that his/her clothing choices are weird?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Where do Indians normally buy clothes?</strong><br>well, people visit a variety of shops and a mall to buy clothes. People who are not friendly with online shopping prefer to buy clothes from the local market but the young generation purchases clothes from online websites. People buy home-wear clothes from the street market because only street shops provide clothes at a very low price.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Indians buy clothes from a variety of places. I think for fancy clothes people normally shop at malls or branded shops like Zara and for day-to-day or basically casual wear, people go to the street markets. Recently, many people have also started buying clothes online.</p><p><strong>2. The difference between men’s and women’s choices of clothes?</strong><br>Girls and boy children look the same, so they wear similar dress types, but as adults, there are body type differences, so they preferred to buy those clothes that suit their bodies and make them more attractive and give them a professional look. Another difference is the colour selection. Men mostly buy blue-white, grey and brown colours but women like bright colour such as pink, red, orange, green.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think the first difference is in the shades. Men go for slightly darker and sombre shades like blue, brown, and grey, while women go for brighter colours like pink, yellow, red, etc. Another difference is that most men prioritize comfort over fashion, while it is vice versa in women’s case.</p><p><strong>3. Do clothes affect people’s mood?</strong><br>Not even I but several studies show our mood can be affected depending on what we wear. Memories or emotions attached to our clothes can evoke excellent or bad feelings when we wear them. When a person, especially a woman, wears a new dress and gives her good comments, she always remembers it whenever she wore the dress. On the other hand, in some places such as office and hospital employees have to wear uniforms, and it doesn’t matter they like it or not at that time some people feel uncomfortable and sad.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, certainly. When people feel they look good in something, they feel more confident, which makes them more social and talkative. The comfort level also matters. If people feel they are uncomfortable in something, it also affects their mood negatively.</p><p><strong>4. What do people consider when buying clothes?</strong><br>People consider colour, quality and stuff mean is cloth is comfortable or not. Women consider one more thing, and that is unique because they want to look different.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>I think people consider many factors while buying clothes. Some of the main factors are cost, colour, brand, comfort, uniqueness, etc. Personally, I prioritize brand and comfort over other factors.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a time when you had to wait in a long line","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a time when you had to wait in a long line.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>When was it?<br>What was it about?<br>How long the queue/line was?<br>How you felt about waiting in this long queue or line?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

I love to visit my grandparents, and I look forward to it, but I dislike the journey and its activities. So it is a trip with a mixed feeling. I go to a place called _______, which is almost 45 kilometers away from where I live. I go there every fortnight. I stay there for two days, and I go by public transport. </p><p><strong>Why you go there? </strong><br>I go there by compulsion and by force. I don’t have any choice.

I enjoy their company a lot. </p><p><strong>Explain why you do not like this trip?</strong> <br>I do not like to take these frequent short trips for many reasons. Although the destination is worth it, the journey is very bumpy. The road is congested, and the bus stops frequently. It is a sheer waste of my time. It is also an unnecessary expense.

I feel uncomfortable there as I am habituated to sleeping on my bed. </p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>Overall, these trips are very tiring and stressful for me. I can neither read nor listen to music on the way due to overcrowded bus. However, I love my grandparents a lot, and I can face any hardships for them. I am trying to convince them to come and stay with us forever so that I can get rid of these irritating and tedious trips. They are very attached to their home, so they disagree with me.

Do Indian people like to travel abroad?</strong><br>Yes, Indian people like to travel and explore a lot. Indian travelers have been travelling to various countries in Southeast Asia and Europe for many centuries. Now the youngsters have more disposable income, so they make short trips to different countries with their friends.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>People are very busy at work. Sometimes, they are frustrated by their everyday lives , so to get away from their monotonous people’s hustle and bustle, preferring to travel to foreign countries to enjoy their holidays. Nowadays youngster not only goes abroad for holidays but they go there for higher education also.</p><p><strong>2. How much time do you think people should spend on a trip abroad?</strong><br>Well! It depends on the purpose of the trip. Sometimes if it is an excursion, it can be just two-three days or maybe a week, but when you have visited a country to study its culture, you may have to stay there for months. On average, I think two weeks are enough to visit a country.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Well, it depends upon the time and the reason for a trip. If people go abroad for holidays then I think one week is enough for it, but if someone goes to another country for official work then I think two to three days are enough and for research and study more than two months people could spend in another nation.</p><p><strong>3. Who prefers travelling abroad, the young or the old?</strong><br>The young and the old both love to travel abroad, provided there are no health issues for older people, and enough funding for young ones. In my family, my father makes a trip abroad every year. Sometimes he visits to meet my siblings residing there and on other occasions just to see another country. My younger brother also makes frequent trips abroad. So I think we all love to travel abroad regardless of age.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think young people love travelling more than older people because they are physically fit, but older adults suffer from health issues, so they face problems during travelling. Young people make frequent trips abroad.</p><p><strong>4. Which is better for knowing more about a country travelling or reading books about it?</strong><br>There is no better learning than travelling. When you travel to a new country, you can soak in the culture, learn a language, try the cuisine, and get a first-hand experience. As compared to this, when you read a book, you are getting a secondhand experience, and you are visualizing or imagining the details narrated by another person or another author.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>I think travelling is more important than reading books to understand people and the world/ different countries. A book about another country only tells you about things such as the country’s history, its people living style and its culture in a very general way but travelling gives a real experience.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a place/person/home you like to visit but you don’t want to live there","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a place/person/home you like to visit but you don’t want to live there.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What place is it?<br>When do you visit that place?<br>How do you feel about it?<br>Why don’t you want to live there?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

What type of apartment do most people in your country like to live in?</strong> <br>Well, it depends on the weather conditions and the area in which they live. The hillside home design is different from the design of a plain area home. Moreover, if people live in<br>because of the open space, but their homes are very small in cities.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Well, it depends on whether a person is living in the city or the countryside. In small cities, most of the people live in independent houses. Only a few metropolitan cities have high-rise buildings. In the rural areas, people live in houses built out of mud or brick depending upon their financial status. One more interesting fact is that majority of the population in my country lives in rented accommodation.</p><p><strong>2. Do people in your country like to invite others as guests?</strong><br>yes, people love to invite others as a guest. It is our culture to respect the guest and give them a special treat. I think inviting others is the best way to spend time with each other and strong the relationship. In addition to this, people also relax their mind while doing chit chat with others.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, people in my country love to invite others as guests. In fact, in our culture, the guests are given the status of Gods. Usually, people like to invite each other for dinners during the holidays. I believe that Indian culture gives a lot more value to relationships than the western world, which is why people here love to develop strong bonds with their neighbours and relatives.</p><p><strong>3. Do people take gifts when they visit each other?</strong><br>well, it depends on the occasion, means when someone visits first time to another’s house, then he/she take the gift. Moreover, on special days such as wedding parties,<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Well, I feel that this is a tradition, which is now slowly dying out. Earlier people were very formal about the relationships, and they never went to someone else’s house empty-handed. People used to carry fruits or other items like clothes during their visits, but I see this trend changing now. People are becoming more casual and do not consider it essential to take a gift when visiting someone. The gifting process is now limited to the holiday season or special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries.</p><p><strong>4. What is the difference between the houses in the city centre and the suburbs</strong>?<br>Urban areas are well planned and structured to offer more residential space for the growing population in cities. But urban sprawl is hard to contain because it is difficult to fit the growing population into a limited space. So people give importance to live in the suburbs or can say the importance of suburbs is growing. Urban living provides better standards of living wit all facilities. Another difference is that suburbs are the sizeable residential area surrounding main cities while urban regions to refer to cities’ core areas.The cost of living in urban areas is higher as compared to suburbs.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>There are many differences between the houses located in posh areas of the city and those located in the outskirts. The primary difference is the price, the houses in city centres are generally expensive, whereas those in the suburbs are generally more affordable. Another reason why people move to suburban areas is that because they can build large houses there and these areas are less crowded as compared to city centres.

If children are afraid of embarrassment, parents can do the same thing in front of children first. For example, once in school, one of my friends’ father encouraged him to dance by himself dancing.

Whenever I think about this day I feel proud of myself. My disagreement was not only a strong one but also very meaningful. </p><p><strong>What you disagreed with? </strong><br>There was a new student in our class and a group of classmates got together and decided to harass him. I completely disagreed with them and expressed my views very clearly with courage. </p><p><strong>What the decision was? and How was it made?</strong><br>All of them got together during the lunch break and thought of doing something unusual. One person suggested to hide the newcomer’s tiffin the next day and call him names. Everyone else readily agreed with the idea. I guess they were all very bored and so wanted to play a prank. The idea did not appeal to me at all.</p><p>I told them to stop thinking in this direction. They did not pay attention to my courteous request and continued to plan the episode. I put my foot down and conveyed to them that I differ in my thinking. I told them clearly that if they do this then I will complain to the authority. </p><p><strong>And explain why you disagreed with it?</strong><br>I disagreed with my classmates because their decision was incorrect and insensitive.

What skills are necessary when making decisions?</strong><br>We make a decision every time for a good future. Different types of skills are required while making a decision; many things have to be kept in mind when deciding because the coming time depends on it. A good decision-maker should be an active listener, logical thinker, right in time management and have problem-solving skills.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Every person has to make decisions from time to time. A good decision requires both head and heart. Decision-makers need to ask themselves whether that decision makes sense, and also whether it feels right.<br>A good decision requires good insight into what all the outcomes of that decision could be. It needs rational thinking and a little ability to look into the future.</p><p><strong>Q2. How can people improve their decision-making skills?</strong><br>well, time and experience teach you everything. Our past mistakes help us to make the right decision for the future.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>With experience, decision-making skills automatically improve. People have to keep in mind what all outcomes could be, and also be ready to face the consequences, whatever they are.</p><p><strong>Q3. How do you think computers will change the way people make decisions?</strong><br>Computers can radically transform the way we make decisions. With computers’ help through the internet, people can communicate with their friends and share their situation. Their friends can help people by sharing their experience and also give them good advice.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Computers can change the way people make decisions, as now through computers; people can post their dilemmas in many forums and advise other people who have faced similar situations.</p><p><strong>Q4. Do parents in India allow their children to make important decisions about the future?</strong><br>Honestly speaking, no Indian parents do not allow their children to make important decisions about the future. In childhood, parents decide, and during the starting of their college, parents advise their children and help them in their course selection.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>No, parents in India generally like to make important decisions about the future of their children. They like to have their say when their child has to choose his/her future career, and also when he/she has to choose his/her, life partner.</p><p><strong>Q5. Do you think that parents should make important decisions for their children?</strong><br>According to my perception, parents should help their children to make important decisions, not to make decisions for them because it makes them dependent and loses their self-confidence.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>I think parents should have a healthy discussion with their children when they have to make an important decision, and then let them have the final say.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a time when you felt bored","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a time when you felt bored.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>When it was?<br>Who you were with?<br>What you were doing?<br>Why you felt bored?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

We reached Chandigarh late night and we checked-in the hotel, and after having a sound sleep, the next morning we were all set to go for sightseeing. </p><p>Unfortunately, somehow my friends got to know that there is a match between India and Australia today in the stadium. Since they follow cricket fanatically. So, immediately they changed the plan to go to stadium ins of sightseeing. As I really do not like the game, I tried to convince them we better go for sightseeing but all in vain. </p><p><strong>Why you felt bored?</strong><br>Eventually, I had to accompany my friends, and now I was in the stadium with my friends. I must say that cricket is very long and boring game with hundreds of rules that nobody can easily follow and understand. Though my friends were shouting and hooting with enthusiasm but, I was quiet and bor I had nothing to do at all, to kill the time I decided to use my mobile.</p><p>But there was a network issue, and in no time my mobile battery got flat as well. Anyway, I was so bored that I decided to take a nap for sometime when I got up the game was still on. Now I walked out of stands for a walk and to have some food in the food courts. </p><p><strong>Conclusion: </strong><br>Finally, the disaster was over, and the match got finished at 5 pm. </p><p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><ul><li>There have been many times when I have felt bored, but today I would like to talk about one such day which was dull.</li></ul><p><strong>When it was?</strong></p><ul><li>It was during the summer of 2019.</li><li>My college exams had just gotten over, and I was completely free.</li><li>Since it was really hot outside, I couldn’t go out much and was getting bored sitting at home.</li></ul><p><strong>Who you were with?</strong></p><ul><li>One day, one of my friends called me and told me about a new Bollywood movie that was going to release the next day.</li><li>The name of the movie was Student of the Year 2.</li></ul><p><strong>What you were doing?</strong></p><ul><li>I immediately saw the movie trailer on youtube and asked my friend to book the tickets.</li><li>The movie was about a group of college students who get into a competition.</li><li>I thought it was going to be a comedy movie and we would have a good time.</li></ul><p><strong>Why you felt bored?</strong></p><ul><li>But as soon as the movie started, we started cursing our luck.</li><li>It was one of the worst movies of the year.</li><li>The movie’s plot was utterly predictable, and there was no laughter in the scenes at all.</li><li>Even the performance of the actors was below average.</li><li>It felt like someone was torturing us.</li><li>As soon as the first half got over, I asked my friend to leave the movie and go do something else.</li><li>But he thought that probably the second half of the movie would be more interesting, and I listened to his advice and stayed back.</li><li>Unfortunately, the second half was even worse than the first one.</li><li>The jokes were not funny, and the script of the movie was terrible.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><ul><li>Somehow I convinced my friend to leave before the movie ended.</li><li>It was one of the most boring experiences of my life.</li></ul><h4><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 3 : Follow up Questions</strong></h4><p>Here some examples of follow up questions that you may asked during your speaking part 3 by examiner related to cue card “describe a time when you felt bored”.</p><p><strong>Q1. When do people feel bored?</strong><br>Most of the time, people feel bored when there is no change in their routine and repeatedly do the same thing. Boredom happens due to monotony in life. Sometimes, it may also depend on an individual’s mood or if a person does not find interest in the things he/she is doing.</p><p><strong>Q2. What can people do when they feel bored?</strong><br>People can do many things when they are bored. They can watch a good movie, listen to some excellent music or go for a walk. They can also talk to their loved ones or maybe play a game with them. Basically, they should try to do something different than usual.</p><p><strong>Q3. Do people get bored with daily routines?</strong><br>Definitely, yes, I think it is the leading cause for boredom. There are numerous examples of when people get bored because of daily routines. For instance, I cannot eat homecooked food for more than five days in a row; it makes me feel that life is dull and there is no fun. Similarly, the weekend brings a nice change from the boring monotony of weekdays.</p><p><strong>Q4. Is it easier for younger people to feel bored than for the old?</strong><br>I believe so; it could be since older people are more experienced and patient as compared to young ones. They have seen most of the things in life, so they do not have high expectations, whereas the young ones, especially today’s generation, always look for something to feed their minds. They easily become bored if they do not get something new.</p>"},{"title":"Describe the time when you had to sing a song or a poem in front of public","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe the time when you had to sing a song or a poem in front of public.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Where were you?<br>What did you sing?<br>How did you feel?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Do people in your country often travel by bike?<br></strong>Yes, bicycle is the most popular means of transport in my country, as we are still a developing country. It is difficult for majority of the population to afford expensive transport mediums like cars or motorbikes. In fact, the government in our country is also promoting bicycling as it brings a lot of benefits for the society and our environment.</p><p><strong>2. Which is more convenient, bicycle or a car?<br></strong>I would say that both of them have their own pros and cons. The car is obviously more convenient when it comes to driving in harsh weather or when you have to reach someplace faster but for shorter distances and especially in congested areas of cities, where the volume of traffic is really high and parking space limited, bicycle is a better choice.</p><p><strong>3. Do you think that children should learn the skills of riding from an early age?<br></strong>Yes, I believe that children should definitely start learning how to ride from an early age. My parents bought me my first cycle when I was 10 years old and it helped me become more confident about myself. I could go out with my friends on my own and I would say that it also helps to burn that extra energy when we are young.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think cycling is a good way to exercise?<br></strong>Yes, like I said before it is one of the best ways to exercise and stay fit. Cycling is not just an exercise for the legs rather it is a complete cardiovascular workout. Even doctors also advise people to commute using a bicycle instead of driving in a car. In this way, people, who live a hectic lifestyle can manage a workout in their schedule without doing anything extra.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a computer/phone game you enjoy playing since your childhood","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a computer/phone game you enjoy playing since your childhood<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What the game is about?<br>When you started playing it?<br>How often you play this game?<br>Why you enjoy playing it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

The positive part is that it helps them to relax and take out the stress from their studies. Also, to some extent, it aids in the development of creative or problem-solving skills. On the contrary, gaming is easily addictive and too much of it can be detrimental for their health and education. Finally, the violent content in some games could promote violent behaviour amongst children.</p><p><strong>2. Should parents or teachers take necessary action to prevent children from playing games?</strong><br>I do not think that parents should stop children from playing computer games, but I believe that it is important for them to supervise the gaming habits of their children. They should monitor the number of hours and type of games being played by the children. If the child is getting addicted to gaming then they should counsel him/her.</p><p><strong>3. What do you think are the benefits of playing games?</strong><br>Like I mentioned before, gaming helps in a lot of ways. First of all, it helps in the development of logical reasoning when children try to solve the challenges in different levels of the game. Secondly, it promotes creativity amongst children as most of the games are based on imaginary concepts and the characters in these games are able to do things that would be otherwise impossible in the real world. So, I think it kind of helps in developing out-of-the-box thinking.</p><p><strong>4. Why games have been popular amongst teenagers in recent years?</strong><br>I think there are multiple reasons why gaming culture has become more popular of late. The biggest reason would definitely be the easy access to free games on mobile devices. Earlier, in order to enjoy gaming, people had to buy expensive gaming consoles and the quality of the games was also not that good. But, nowadays majority of the teenagers have cell phones with them in which one can install multiple, high-end games for free. Also, teenagers can do multiplayer gaming which is much more fun.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a time when you were really close to a wild animal","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a time when you were really close to a wild animal<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What it looked like?<br>Where you saw it?<br>What it likes to eat or do?<br>Why you like it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

(Why?/Why not?)</strong><br>Yes, I check the weather but not regularly. Whenever I plan to go out on vacations, I check the weather because it is necessary to be prepared in advance.<br><strong>OR<br></strong>Yes, I pay attention to the weather forecast on a regular basis. The reason is I travel a lot and it becomes necessary to know about the weather to be prepared in advance. Also, climate change has made the weather unpredictable. It sometimes rains even in the dry season as such knowing the weather on a day-to-day basis has become a necessity.</p><p><strong>2. How does the weather (or, the weather forecast) affect what activities people do?</strong><br>Weather affects us in several ways. Climate influences the crops because it affects their growth. Moreover, the weather affects transportation. Temperature strongly controls what fruits and vegetables can grow. It also affects our eating habit, such as most people like to eat snacks on rainy days. In addition to this people wear loose dresses in hot weather and wear warm dresses in cold weather.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>People prefer to stay indoors on hot sunny days or rainy days and go out for picnics on pleasant days. Also, there are things we like to eat in certain weather – for example, fritters on rainy days, ice creams on warm days, etc. It also affects the clothing patterns. People wear light-colored loose cotton dresses in summers and dark warm clothes in cold weather.</p><p><strong>3. (Similar to above) How does the weather affect people’s daily lives?</strong></p><p><strong>4. Why do some people dislike some kinds of weather?</strong><br>I think it’s because the weather can limit people’s activities. If the weather restricts people from enjoying their favorite activity, it can make them dislike that weather. My friend hates rainy days because he likes to play cricket and he can’t do that because of the rain.</p><p><strong>5. Do people wear different clothes in different types of weather (or, different seasons)? ( Same as 2)</strong></p><p><strong>6. Does the weather have an effect on the economy?</strong><br>Yes, weather affects the economy. For example, in some countries, people cannot do work because of snow, which affects the company and economy of that country. Moreover, some fruits and crops do not require much rain, but due to much rain, crops spoil in the rainy season.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>Yes, the weather affects our economy. For example, due to milder winters, a lot of people from cold northern countries visit us during that time. Thus it promotes tourism. Also, certain weather like hot sunny days boosts the earning of local ice cream vendors. Similarly, winters boost the jackets and sweaters industry.</p><p><strong>7. (Similar but different) (In your country), are there any differences in economic activity in the different seasons?</strong><br>Yes, economic activities are different in different seasons in India. For example, people love to visit the northern part of India in summer, such as Shimla, which increases that area’s economic level. Moreover, people wear and purchase warm clothes in winter and cotton and loose clothes in summer. Weather does not only affect people living style, but different crops are grown in different seasons.<br><strong>OR</strong><br>There are differences in certain economic activities. For example, warm clothes’ industry gets a boost in the winter season. Similarly, farming is also dependent upon seasons – certain crops like rice are grown in summers whereas others like wheat in winters.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a part of a city or a town you enjoy spending time in","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a part of a city or a town you enjoy spending time in<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>where it is?<br>what it is like?<br>what do you do there?<br>and explain why you enjoy spending time there?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

My desktop is very old, and a laptop is brand new. </p><p><strong>What were you doing? </strong><br>It so happened that my cousin had to prepare an assignment, and he asked me for my laptop for a few hours. His computer was not working very smoothly. Initially, I hesitated to give him because I am very possessive about it. But then I thought of helping him.

What do people use computers for?<br></strong>Well, these days the use of computers is limitless, especially in the last year people around the world are using computers as mini offices. We can store our pictures, we can study online with the help of computers and we can even watch movies. So, it depends on people’s personal preferences.</p><p><strong>2. Should students be allowed to use computers at school?</strong><br>I am a strong supporter of the use of computers at school. The main reason why I think so is that they would help them to understand their lessons with illustrations and make learning more interesting. This will also make them fetch the data from anywhere in the world. They can share their knowledge with their teachers instantly by making use of a computer.</p><p><strong>3. What do you think of people who are addicted to computers?</strong><br>Most of the people think that computer addiction is very bad, but my views are not the same. I think if you want to do anything in life you need passion and you need a certain amount of addiction. In the present scenario, we are working with the help of computers. We are locked down in our homes, so we entertain ourselves on computers, we communicate with the near and dear ones with the help of computers. But at the same time, we need to go out exercise and get up after every half an hour or one hour to give rest to eyes and to exercise or body.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think computers make our life simpler or more complex?<br></strong>Computers make life simpler but these days we are performing many tasks and want all done faster so it seems that they have made our life complex. Imagine in the earlier times if we had to share any news, we had to write a letter to each person and to post it and wait for the reply for a week or so or sometimes even longer. As compared to it, now we have to just type it press a button and share with everyone, so I think they have made our everyday life simpler not complex.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a polite person whom you know","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a polite person whom you know.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Who is the person?<br>How you know him/her?<br>And explain why you think this person is polite?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Unfortunately, not many possess it. </p><p><strong>Who is the person?</strong><br>These days, most people are abrupt and rude, but I feel lucky to know an extremely soft-spoken Mr. Singh, my Maths teacher. I have observed his politenara’As throughout my school time. </p><p><strong>How you know him/her?</strong><br>He was our Mathematics teacher, as you know, usually mathematics teachers very strict by their nature but, Mr. Singh had a very calm and friendly nature where most students find maths a very difficult subject and avoid it. </p><p><strong>Explain why you think this person is polite?</strong><br>But, because of the polite and soft nature of Mr. Singh, students developed their interest in learning Mathematics as he never used to get angry or punish students for not completing their work. Rather teach them in a more practical and easier way. </p><p>In fact, he was not even harsh with students who used to create indiscipline. Mr. Singh always used to make them realise their mistakes very politely. For his polite nature, he was respected by students as well as teachers, and everyone used to enjoy his company. </p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br>I vividly remember, when I was taking extra Maths classes near exams at his home, I observed he was equally polite with his family as others.

I was returning from my farm, and my vehicle broke down. I was walking, and there were puddles due to heavy rain. Many cars passed by and splashed water on me. One car passed so slowly that not a single drop of water splashed on my dress. It was a black ambassador with a red light on top. The colonel was sitting inside, and he offered me a lift. This is how I met him. </p><p><strong>Explain why you think this person is polite?</strong><br>I think he was polite because despite being a person from such a high cadre, he respected me. He offered me some water and went and sat in the front seat with the driver to make me comfortable. He gave me his phone so that I could call my parents and inform them about my whereabouts. He dropped me home, and my parents thanked him. </p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br>I was honoured to meet a very noble army person.

On a normal day, I would have managed without it. However, because it was a competition, it was required for me to be vigilant and protect my kite and its string from other competitors. One more significant reason was that I suffer from migraines, and my head starts aching when I am into direct sunlight. </p><p><strong>What was the result of your forgetting?</strong><br>What was the result of my forgetting? Initially, I was very angry with myself. There was no time to go back home and get my goggles because the competition had begun. So, what I did is I found a shade and managed to at least start flying my kite anyhow. As soon as my kite was up in the sky, I gave a call to my friend who was going to join me sometime. </p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br>I requested him to come fast and get me an extra pair of glares along with him. He did come fast, and my problem was finally solved. But there were two consequences of my forgetting my sunglasses. One is that my head started to pain badly, and the other is that I did not enjoy the competition due to all the chaos. But yes, I learnt a lesson to prepare in advance so that I don’t miss important things in a hurry. </p><p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><ul><li>I think there are many situations in my life where I have forgotten something. </li></ul><p><strong>When did it happen?</strong> <strong>And What you forgot?</strong></p><ul><li>Today, I’d like to talk about an incident when I forgot my documents, and it led to an unnecessary delay in my passport application. </li><li>I had recently applied for a new passport as my old one had got expired. </li><li>The process of getting a new passport usually takes a month; it starts with filling an online application.

However, there are many traditions that people follow.</p><p><strong>What is it?</strong><br>I would like to talk about the tradition of touching the feet of elders for a blessing.</p><p><strong>Who takes part in it?</strong> and <strong>What activities there are?</strong><br>This tradition is in practice since times Immemorial. It originated in Gurukuls, where students used to touch their guru’s feet to take their blessings. Later it became a common practice to touch the feet of elders or seniors for blessings.</p><p><strong>And explain how you feel about it?</strong><br>This is something every parent teaches to the children to learn the importance of giving respect to seniors and keeping this tradition alive. For example, I start my every morning by touching my father’s feet and my grandfather, and their blessings keep me in high spirits all day long.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Unfortunately, these days many modern parents are not giving this value to their young ones because of which they are getting detached from local traditions and cultures, and it can be a huge loss to the nation if this practice becomes obsolete. Therefore, it is important to put every effort to keep the rituals and traditions alive forever.</p><p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction:</strong> <br>Well, India has a rich culture that has become our identity.

People from the older generation pass their beliefs and cultures to the upcoming generation. </p><p><strong>Explain how you feel about it?</strong><br>Thus every child that behaves well with others has already learned about their tradition from grandparents and parents.

Who is usually the leader in an Indian family?</strong><br>India is a patriarchal society, and, in most families, the eldest male member is the leader. If it’s a joint family, its generally the grandfather and in nuclear families, it’s the father.</p><p><strong>2. How do grandparents take care of their children?</strong><br>I think today grandparents fill the void left behind by working parents. Both the parents work today and as such, are not able to devote enough time to the children. So, grandparents raise children just like parents. They also teach them about moral values. In some ways, they are also responsible for spoiling children as they give in to their demands much more easily than parents too.</p><p><strong>3. What’s the most important quality of a good parent?</strong><br>I think the best quality of a good parent is flexibility. Flexible parents tend to be open-minded and easy-going. They resolve disagreements smoothly. Kids are naturally defiant, and thus, inflexible parents increase defiance and rebelliousness in their kids, and this always escalates conflicts.</p><p><strong>4. How can new parents learn about parenting?</strong><br>I think there are many ways to learn about good parenting. They can read books on parenting. They can join parenting classes, they can watch video on you-tube about parenting and last, but not least, they can take guidance from their own parents.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a person who you think is very open","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a person who you think is very open.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Who this person is?<br>How you know this person?<br>Why do you think this person is very open?<br>And explain how you feel about this person?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Actually, he is quite bold by nature right from childhood.</p><p><strong>Why do you think this person is very open?</strong></p><p>He was born and brought up in New Delhi and had an opportunity to study at convent school. At the same time, he is extremely competitive by nature that’s why, since childhood he is far more frank and open than me and others. In addition, few years ago he moved to Canada for his study where he got the exposure and now after returning he talks even more frankly. For example, when we sit with our seniors I often hesitate to talk but he can freely talk on any topic. In fact, in my country on some social topics where people do not feel comfortable to talk he has no problem in presenting his views.</p><p>Similarly, when we go out he just doesn’t mind interacting with new people especially travellers from different country.

Is it difficult for Indian people to express their feelings?</strong><br>Yes, Indian people are very emotional and polite compared to a foreigner, so they feel shy while publicly expressing their feelings.</p><p><strong>2. Who do you think to talk more? Children or grown-ups?</strong><br>Definitely children are more talkative as compared to an adult. The first reason for their behaviour is that they do not feel shy while speaking and don’t care about other people they talk about.</p><p><strong>3. What do you think is the difference between boys and girls in expressing their feelings?</strong><br>Generally speaking, girls are more expressive than boys. Boys hide their, feeling but girls do not.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think people are more open than in the past?</strong><br>Nowadays, people are more selfish and self-centred, so they hide many things, and they also want to save their image; that’s why they do not express their feelings openly. On the other hand, people in the past were very helpful and supportive, so they express their feelings openly.</p><p><strong>5.

What is the influence of social media on friendships?</strong><br>I think social media has definitely enabled us to maintain friendships better. We all know our friends are just a click away. At the same time, it has all reduced face to face contact, and I think that has weakened the bonds of friendships.</p><p><strong>2. Why do people lose contact with each other after graduation?</strong><br>I think the main reason is that we get busy with jobs. Moreover, sometimes people move to another city for a job. We don’t see our friends daily, and we come in contact with new people. Building new friendships consumes time, and thus inadvertently people lose touch with friends.</p><p><strong>3. Do people in your country like to make new friends?</strong><br>Definitely, I think Indians, in essence, are very social. We love conversation, meeting new people. Every time, I travel, I come back with a new contact in my phone.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think old friends are more important to the old generation or the young generation?</strong><br>I think old friends are important to both the new and old generation. I think talking with childhood friends takes people back to childhood days in some sense, and most people miss that time – a time free of tensions and worries.</p>"},{"title":"Describe an energetic person that you know","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an energetic person that you know.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Who is this person?<br>How do you know this person?<br>Why do you think this person is energetic?<br>And explain how you feel about this person?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

What kind of jobs need a lot of physical activity?</strong><br>I think with the coming of computers and technology, a lot of jobs don’t require as much physical activity as in the past. Still, there are a few jobs that involve manual labour like masonry, plumbing, painting etc. which involve a lot of physical activity.</p><p><strong>2. What’s the difference between payment for physical work and payment for mental work?</strong><br>It’s a fact that today as a society, we give more importance to mental work as compared to physical work. So, jobs that require mental work entail a much higher salary than jobs with physical work. In India, especially, jobs with physical work like farming, plumbing, painting, working in factories are some of the least paid jobs.</p><p><strong>3. Can physical workers have higher salaries in the future?</strong><br>On the contrary, I think physical workers would have even lower salaries in the future relatively. This is because machines are gradually replacing manual work, and I think the need for manual labour is coming down tremendously.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think machines could replace manual labor in the future?</strong><br>I don’t think machines will replace manual labor completely, but there would definitely be an impact. I think with the coming of new technologies, new types of jobs will be created, which will require different skill sets. This, in fact, is already visible for example, with the coming of driverless cars – there has been a fall in the jobs for drivers.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a conversation topic you were not interested in","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a conversation topic you were not interested in.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Who you talked with?<br>When you had the conversation?<br>What was the topic?<br>And explain why you were not interested?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

How do you know if others are not interested in the conversation?</strong><br>I think I mostly see people’s facial reactions to see if they are interested. If they are laughing at my jokes or their facial reactions are changing as the tone of the conversation changes, they are interested. Otherwise, they are not. Sometimes people are direct too. They try to cut me off and steer the conversation towards another topic.</p><p><strong>4. What’s the influence of modern technology such as the internet, emails on our communication?</strong><br>I think they have increased the overall communication, but at the same time, they have also decreased face to face communication. Moreover, they have reduced the importance of language and grammar in communication. People care more about being concise rather than being grammatically correct.</p>"},{"title":"Describe an expensive activity that you enjoy doing occasionally","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an expensive activity that you enjoy doing occasionally.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What is it?<br>Who do you do it with?<br>Why is it expensive?<br>And explain how you feel about it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

What can individuals do for scientific research?</strong><br>I think most science inventions happen accidentally. Individuals see a need, and they come up with an idea to address that need.

What influence can international cooperation in science bring about?</strong><br>There main challenges to scientific research in today’s time is the lack of funding and lack of access to information. International cooperation can address both of them.

Giving reward is also a way to appreciate someone for their work, and these criteria is followed by almost all the sections of mankind. </p><p>If I talk about myself, I’ve recieved numerous awards since my childhood. My parents have always given me a prize whenever I broke my own record in my academics.

Besides that, there are various competitions in schools like sports competitions, debate competition, quiz competition, dance and singing competitions, which entail prizes.</p><p><strong>2. Should students get the same prize in sports and academics?</strong><br>I think yes, sports and academics are the same in my eyes. I think they both have their own importance. Therefore, a student who excels in sports should be awarded the same way as students who excel in academics.</p><p><strong>3. Why should people be awarded?</strong><br>I think awards are foremost recognition of a person’s efforts and hard work. They also build a spirit of competition. In other words, awards make people more motivated and work harder. I think very few of us are self-motivated, and awards act as an external source of motivation.</p><p><strong>4. Are awards always good for the winners?</strong><br>No, I don’t think they are always good. They can also create a feeling a superiority among the winners that they are better than others. This in return, can also create a feeling a complacency among the winners and stop them from working with the same level of dedication and commitment as they did before.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a time when you first talked in a foreign language","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a time when you first talked in a foreign language.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Where were you?<br>Who were you with?<br>What did you talk about?<br>And explain how you felt about it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

At what age should children start learning a foreign language?</strong><br>With regards to learning a foreign language, I think the earlier, the better. So, I think primary school is the best stage to start learning a foreign language. Young children have less inhibitions and don’t hesitate while speaking. Also, there is a lot of burden of studies in secondary school.</p><p><strong>2. Which skill is more important speaking or writing?</strong><br>I think both are equally important. A few years ago, I would have said that speaking is more important, but with the coming of the internet, we have started communicating in the form of emails and chats and so writing today is equally important.</p><p><strong>3 .Does a person still need to learn another language if he is good in English?</strong><br>I think learning another language is always beneficial. Bilingual children are better at multitasking and thinking out of the box. Learning another language also helps in the mental development of children. I think I have read it at many places that bilingual children outperform monolingual children academically.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think minority languages will disappear?</strong><br>Unfortunately, yes. I think it is already happening. There are many reasons for it, but the primary reason is English is prioritized in most of the countries as it gives a competitive advantage in jobs. Moreover, linguists around the world are also not doing enough to protect minority languages. There is research into minor aspects of languages like English and French, while minority languages are completely ignored.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a good decision you made recently","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a good decision you made recently.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What was it?<br>When you made it?<br>What was the result?<br>And explain how you felt about it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

What decisions do people make every day?</strong><br>I think we all make plenty of decisions everyday like what do buy, what to eat, what to watch on television and what to say to others. Then, there are decisions people have to take related to work and so on.</p><p><strong>2. Why do people make decisions?</strong><br>People make decisions to feel in control. Decisions give us a feeling that we are the masters of our fate. No one else can control our fate. Decisions also give direction to our life. Every decision has a consequence and it takes our life in a certain direction.</p><p><strong>3. Can children take decisions on their own?</strong><br>Yes, I think even children can take decisions on their own, but I also believe their likelihood of making a mistake is higher than others as they are worldly-wise. Thus, parents should take decisions for children when they are young and gradually as they grow up, allow them to take decisions on their own.</p><p><strong>4. When do people change their decision?</strong><br>I think changing a decision is all about our conscience. When we get that feeling inside that we have made a mistake or we are doing the wrong thing, we try and change our decision. And if we don’t change our decision, we always feel guilty about doing the wrong thing.</p>"},{"title":"Describe an event you attended in which you didn’t like the music played","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an event you attended in which you didn’t like the music played.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What was the event?<br>Where were you?<br>What music was like?<br>And explain why you didn’t like the music?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Why do so many young people spend a lot of money on concerts?</strong><br>I think it is mainly because of the experience. Hearing a singer on the screen can never match the feeling of hearing them live. Also, I think it’s about spending quality time with friends.</p><p><strong>2. Do you think older people like the same music as young people?</strong><br>I feel young people like pop, rock music, basically any music that they can dance to. They don’t care about the lyrics; they care more about the fast beats. Old people are more into soft, slow, music. They actually pay more attention to the lyrics.</p><p><strong>3. Do you think music concerts are suitable for old people to attend?</strong><br>I think it might be physically taxing for the old people to stand for so long at a concert. But otherwise, I think if the old people can manage the physical exertion, the concerts are certainly suitable. Today many concerts also offer chairs, where older people can sit and enjoy the show rather than having to stand.</p><p><strong>4. Why do shopping malls often have background music?</strong><br>I think the music is there to enhance the experience of shopping. We remember shopping through not only sight but also through music playing in the background.</p>"},{"title":"Describe an ambition that you have for long time","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an ambition that you have for long time.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>What is it?<br>What did you do for it?<br>When can you achieve it?<br>And explain why you have this ambition?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

What kinds of ambition do people have?</strong><br>I think ambitions vary with age. In school, student’s ambitions are to get into a good college or a university. Some youngsters with a creative mindset also dream about becoming a successful celebrity or a successful singer. As people finish their education, the ambition is to get a high-paid job in a reputed firm and then after children, children’s ambitions become the parent’s ambitions too.</p><p><strong>2. Why should parents encourage children to have ambitions?</strong><br>I think ambitions give direction to children. It makes sure they are dedicated and less likely to fall off the track. Moreover, if children are ambitious, they are less likely to fall down on failing. They are always willing to try again.</p><p><strong>3. Should parents interfere with their children’s ambitions?</strong><br>I think if parents interfere with children’s ambitions, it would create a feeling of resentment among the children for the parents. It would have disastrous long-term consequences for their relationship. I think parents should be supportive of their children’s dreams, but they can encourage them to keep backups and not put all their eggs into one basket.</p><p><strong>4. Is there any difference of the ambition of grown-ups and that of children?</strong><br>I think grown-up’s ambitions are much more realistic than children because they know that life is full of problems and hurdles. Children, on the other hand, sometimes have very unrealistic ambitions. Children also don’t get much disheartened on failing to achieve their goals, while adults sometimes even go into a depression on failing.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a time when you changed your opinion","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a time when you changed your opinion.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>When was it?<br>What was the original opinion?<br>Why you changed it?<br>And explain how you felt about it.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Do children like to change opinion?</strong><br>I think they do, but it is hard for them. I think children are more emotional than adults, and this means that they form an opinion based on emotions. Emotional decisions, in turn, are very hard to change because it hurts our ego when we change them.</p><p><strong>2. Why do people change opinion?</strong><br>People change opinion when they find contradicting evidence against their previously held opinion. If they don’t change, they suffer from guilt and thus, although they may resist at first, they slowly do change.</p><p><strong>3. Who do young people turn to for advice?</strong><br>I think young people mainly turn to family or figures of authority like teachers and school counsellors for advice. Some youth also turn to their peers for suggestions. Whom they turn to for advice depends upon the matter concerned and the decisions relevance in their lives.</p><p><strong>4. Do people like giving an opinion about politics?</strong><br>Indian people are very opinionated when it comes to politics, and they are not shy in expressing their beliefs as well. And I think this is good because this means people are politically active and they are thinking about governments decisions and policies. This also means they put a value on their vote.</p>"},{"title":"Describe an intelligent person you know","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe an intelligent person you know.<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>Who is the person?<br>What does he/she do?<br>Why do you think he/she is smart?<br>How do you feel about him/her?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

In fact, he helps students of the class in understanding this subject in a better way. He is always in the good books of the teachers; this is perhaps the reason why he is also the monitor of the class.</p><p>One thing that really impresses me about Karan is that he is not only good at academics, but he is equally good at extracurricular activities. My school organizes various competitions, for example, speech competition, quiz contests, and he takes part in all of these and usually win the best prize as well.</p><p><strong>How do you feel about him/her?</strong><br>In fact, he is the captain of the school’s cricket team, so his intelligence is not confined to just academics, but he is also really smart at other activities.

Are most intelligent people happy? Why?</strong><br>Not necessarily. Intelligent people have high expectations of life. They may feel unhappy if things don’t go according to their expectations. But, at the same time i think it is difficult to generalise. Intelligent people know that happiness is a state of mind, and so they may try their best to stay happy.</p><p><strong>2. Do you think intelligent people are selfish?</strong><br>No, selfishness has nothing to do with intelligence. I think it is personal nature to be selfish. A person who is intelligent may get success in his life and may seem to be selfish, but actually he is not. Even people who are not so intelligent may be selfish. It is basic human nature to look after one’s own interests first. So, it cannot be said that intelligence makes people selfish.</p><p><strong>3. Do you think intelligent people are helpful?</strong><br>Well, a helpful nature also has nothing to do with intelligence. Anybody can be helpful, but intelligent people can help in better ways with their intelligence. People who are not intelligent but have money can help by giving money, but intelligent people can help by educating the poor.</p><p><strong>4. Who do you think plays a more important role in children’s education, parents or teachers? Why?</strong><br>Well, both have a vital role in children’s education. The role of both parents and teachers is different, but equal. So, it is difficult to say, who has a greater role. In social education, parents have a greater role, but in academic education, teachers have a greater role.</p><p><strong>5. What qualities do you think a good teacher should have?</strong><br>A teacher should have good communication skills. Without good communication skills, a teacher cannot teach well. Secondly, he should have depth of knowledge of the subject. Then, he should be impartial. He should have no bias towards the rich or poor students. He should be able to come down to the level of the student to teach well.</p><p><strong>6. How do teachers help children in their education?</strong><br>Teachers help in all possible ways. They work hard to provide good academic knowledge to the students. They have to keep themselves up-to-date with the latest syllabi and teach students according to the requirement of the time. They can also do some career counselling and advise the students any career path according to their aptitude.</p><p><strong>7. Why are some children more intelligent than others?</strong><br>It can be because of genes. Some may be born intelligent. Some children may work hard to achieve that level of intelligence.</p>"},{"title":"Describe a photo of yourself that you like (or you have taken)","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#eee\">Describe a photo of yourself that you like (or you have taken).<br><br><strong>You should say</strong><br>When was it taken?<br>Where was it taken?<br>Who took it?

You can do font adjustments. </p><p><strong>5. Some people like to collect books. Why do you think they do this? </strong><br>They do so because they love books. They treat books as collectibles and are proud of their collection. </p><p><strong>6. Is compulsory reading (in school) is a good idea? </strong><br>Yes, definitely. For students to achieve in math, science, English, history, geography, and other subjects, reading skills must be developed to the point that most of them are automatic. Students cannot struggle with word recognition when they should be reading quickly for the comprehension of a text. But the ability to read and write develops with careful planning and instruction. Children need regular and active interactions with print. <br><br><strong>Reading is a Good Workout </strong><br>Just like muscles, the brain benefits from a good workout. And reading is more demanding than watching TV or listening to the radio. <br><br><strong>Reading Builds Vocabulary </strong><br>While reading books, especially challenging ones, you will find yourself exposed to many new words you wouldn’t be otherwise.<br><br><strong>Reading Helps Self Esteem </strong><br>Another one of the key reading benefits is that the more you read, the more knowledgeable you become.

What type of books do children read nowadays? </strong><br>What type of books did children like reading in the past, and what do you think they will read in the future? Nowadays, generally speaking, the reading habit of the children is on the decline. Whatever books they read are based on fantasy, fiction and supernatural characters like Barbie, superman and Shaktiman. <br>Fifty years ago – Children read a lot. They read moral and spiritual books.

Also, another thing we can do is to engross ourselves at work. Only if we are free, we can waste time. We should always keep doing something in our free time. In other words, we should never be free actually.</p><p><strong>2. Is time management important?</strong><br>Yes, time management is really important. I think there is only a resource that we can never get back, and that is time. And there is no bigger regret in life than wasting time.</p><p><strong>3. Should parents help children manage their time?</strong><br>Yes, in the beginning, yes. They can make a timetable for them and make sure they follow it. If children develop such a habit at a young age, it stays with them for life.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think relaxing is a waste of time?</strong><br>No, I don’t think relaxing is a waste of time. However, relaxing should be doing nothing. I feel relaxed when I do things I love. Just sitting idle is a waste of time. It is better to do something in our free time than to just sit idle.</p><h4>Some useful vocabulary</h4><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">utilize<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> make practical and effective use of.<br><strong>Example:</strong> vitamin C helps your body utilize the iron present in your diet</p><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">engross<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> absorb all the attention or interest of.<br><strong>Example:</strong> they seemed to be engrossed in conversation</p><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">idle<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> avoiding work; lazy<br><strong>Example:</strong> idle students</p><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">lockdown<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> a state of isolation or restricted access instituted as a security measure.<br><strong>Example:</strong> the university is <strong>on lockdown</strong> and nobody has been able to leave</p>"},{"title":"Describe something or someone that made a lot of noise.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background\">Describe something or someone that made a lot of noise.<br><br><strong>You should say:</strong><br>Who or what made the noise?<br>What was the noise like?<br>What did you do when you heard the noise?<br>And how you feel about it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Where can people hear a lot of noise?</strong><br>People can hear a lot of noise at public places like bus stations, railway stations, malls and so on. Moreover, in big cities, there is a lot of noise on the roads during traffic because of honking. In India, religious places also use loudspeakers, and thus there is a lot of noise there.</p><p><strong>2. What may happen when someone listens to very loud music using headphones when they are running or hiking?</strong><br>I think in the long term, it might cause permanent damage to the ears. Moreover, it may also lead to accidents as people while running might not hear car horns due to loud music. So, I would not consider it to be safe to put on loud music in public places.</p><p><strong>3. What can be done to reduce traffic noise?</strong><br>I think the government can make strict rules about honking, and unnecessarily honking should be considered a traffic violation. Also, car engines start making noise after a few years, so people should be encouraged to replaced car engines after a few years.</p><p><strong>4. Do you think the world will be noisier in the future?</strong><br>On the contrary, I think the world would be quieter because people are becoming less social than before. I think the noise is mainly made in social situations. More and more people are becoming introverted, and thus I think the noise would also reduce for this reason. Also, governments have also made strict rules about noise, and thus noise would reduce in the future.</p><h4>Some useful vocabulary</h4><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">nephew<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> a son of one’s brother or sister, or of one’s brother-in-law or sister-in-law<br><strong>Example:</strong> my nephew made a lot of noise</p><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">cracker<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> a decorated paper cylinder which, when pulled apart, makes a sharp noise and releases a small toy or other novelty,a firework that explodes with a sharp noise<br><strong>Example:</strong> he is very fond of bursting crackers</p><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">tolerate<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> allow the existence, occurrence, or practice of (something that one dislikes or disagrees with) without interference<br><strong>Example:</strong> I can’t imagine how my dad tolerated the noise as he was with him outside on the terrace</p><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">honk<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> make or cause to make a honk.<br><strong>Example:</strong> there is a lot of noise on the roads during traffic because of honking</p><p class=\"has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background\">introvert<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> a person predominantly concerned with their own thoughts and feelings rather than with external things<br><strong>Example:</strong> people are becoming introverted</p>"},{"title":"Describe a water sport you would like to try in the future or Describe a sport you would like to try for the first time.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background\">Describe a water sport you would like to try in the future or Describe a sport you would like to try for the first time.<br><br><strong>You should say:</strong><br>What is it?<br>Where you will do it?<br>Whether it is easy or difficult?<br>Why would you like to try it?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

Scuba diving is a wonderful water sport that allows a person to get deep into the water and experience marine life. I got to know about this activity while following a documentary on marine life on the discovery channel.</p><p>To enjoy this activity, a person must wear safety gear and carry an oxygen cylinder in the water that allows a person to stay in deep water for a long time.</p><p><strong>Where you will do it?</strong><br>So to enjoy this activity, I’m planning to go to Goa for holidays with my friends as this place is famous all over the world for its water sports, and I would do scuba diving there.</p><p>Though this activity is a little expensive to afford, it costs around 5-10 thousand just for half an hour’s experience, but I think it would be worthwhile.</p><p>With the necessary equipment, I will get into the sea’s deep water, and there I would experience the marine life.</p><p><strong>Why would you like to try it?</strong><br>It would give me a feeling of being a part of marine life, especially the ecosystem of coral reefs that entice me a lot.<br>Along with other creatures like Jelly Fishes, Octopus, Sea horses, and many more, these days, waterproof cameras are available that we can take along and take the pictures of these rare creatures.</p><p>In addition, scuba diving is also known as to be the most relaxing activity a person can enjoy, so I’m looking forward to trying scuba diving. For that reason, these days, I’m taking swimming classes so that I cm enjoy this activity far more comfortably.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>So, scuba diving is indeed the activity that I’m planning to try for the first time.</p><p><strong>Model Answer 2:</strong></p><p><strong>What is it?</strong> <br>To be honest, I am not a huge fan of water sports, but if I were going to do one, I think it’d be scuba diving.</p><p><strong>Why would you like to try it? and Where you will do it?</strong><br>I am sure it’d be fun and probably a bit of a roller coaster ride. I’ve been snorkelling, and I think to go even deeper to get to see a myriad of creatures and colours, well I can only guess it would take your breath away. </p><p><strong>Whether it is easy or difficult?</strong> <br>I’ve got no idea where I would do it, I’d have to do a bit of research first, but I know it takes a bit of time to learn. As far as I understand it, you need to do a training course for a few days, if not a few weeks.</p><p>It makes sense because you need to use some quite complicated equipment, the oxygen tank, breathing equipment, the mask, and that. If you make a mistake, it can be fatal, so you need to be on top of your game, really know what you are doing. </p><p>I actually learnt from a TV documentary that you also have to be careful about not coming up from the depths too quickly, as the change in water pressure can have an adverse effect on you if you are not too careful. </p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br>I assume if you are well-trained and well-prepared, it’s not really a dangerous sport at all and one that would be exhilarating to have a go at. </p><h4><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 3 : Follow up Questions</strong></h4><p>Here some examples of follow up questions that you may asked during your speaking part 3 by examiner related to cue card “Describe a water sport you would like to try in the future or Describe a sport you would like to try for the first time”.</p><p><strong>1. Which is the most popular water sport in your country?</strong><br>Although India is fully flooded with numerous water sports across the states, such as swimming, banana boat, walking undersea, scuba diving, but most popular is water rafting. Well, professionals are always there to guide people on how to do these sports. Thus, swimming is not a mandated requirement for this particular activity. Since it is more secured water games when compared to others, it gravitates to a huge amount of attention.</p><p><strong>2. Why do people like to do things near water?</strong><br>Perhaps, it is a natural phenomenon that all living beings are fascinated by water bodies, and humans are not an exemption. I believe people enjoy spending leisure time near water as it is relaxing and rejuvenating. Being around water certainly refreshes our moods and provides peace of mind.</p><p><strong>3. Do you think schools should teach students to swim and why?</strong><br>Of course, I second this opinion that schools should include a swimming session for their students since it has become a need of an hour. It is absolutely essential that all children know the basic skills of swimming at a young age as it could be beneficial in case of any emergencies.</p><p><strong>4. Are there many schools teaching swimming?</strong><br>Frankly speaking, I am not really sure about the number of schools teaching swimming to their pupil. However, a good few private schools I have heard of provides this facility. It isn’t possible for many of the schools to teach swimming as it requires a huge amount of funds and space to build a pool along with a trained instructor. Thereby, only a couple of posh schools can afford this.</p><p><strong>5. Do you think it is necessary for everyone to learn to swim?</strong><br>To be frank enough, I think it is one of the essential life skills that everyone should learn. No doubt, it is a recreational activity, which keeps us physically and mentally fit and also helps us to acquire the ability to survive in water.</p><p><strong>6. Do you think the government should spend money on developing facilities for water sports?</strong><br>Indeed yes, the government should build swimming pools and other water facilities for the public welfare, as it provides recreational opportunities for people who can’t afford their own pools. Moreover, it promotes fitness along with the possibility of attracting tourists for water activities near a river or sea, such as boating or white water kayak.</p><h4>Some useful vocabulary</h4><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#8ed1fc\">Rafting<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> the sport or pastime of travelling down a river on a raft<br><strong>Example:</strong> River Rafting and Boating</p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#8ed1fc\">scuba diving<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> the sport or activity of swimming underwater using a scuba.<br><strong>Example:</strong> I intend to try is scuba diving</p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#8ed1fc\">gear<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> equipment or apparatus that is used for a particular purpose<br><strong>Example:</strong> safety gear</p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#8ed1fc\">coral reefs<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> a ridge of rock in the sea formed by the growth and deposit of coral<br><strong>Example:</strong> especially the ecosystem of coral reefs that entice me a lot.</p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#8ed1fc\">entice<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> attract or tempt by offering pleasure or advantage<br><strong>Example:</strong> that entice me a lot</p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#8ed1fc\">rejuvenating<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> make (someone or something) look or feel better, younger, or more vital<br><strong>Example:</strong> I believe people enjoy spending leisure time near water as it is relaxing and rejuvenating</p><p class=\"has-background\" style=\"background-color:#8ed1fc\">recreational<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> relating to or denoting activity done for enjoyment when one is not working<br><strong>Example:</strong> it is a recreational activity</p>"},{"title":"Describe a time when you were surprised to meet a friend.","text":"<p><strong>IELTS Speaking Part 2: IELTS Cue Card</strong></p><p class=\"has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background\">Describe a time when you were surprised to meet a friend.<br><br><strong>You should say:</strong><br>Where it was?<br>Who you met?<br>When was it?<br>Why were you surprised?</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You will have to talk about the topic for one to two minutes.

When I was at a store of the sports shoe brand Nike, I heard a familiar voice, I turned around, and to my surprise, he was my old days’ friend Karan. I called him and he too immediately recognized me. </p><p><strong>Why were you surprised?</strong> <br>We both got surprised to see each other, and we were happy at the same time to meet after such a long period of time. We gave a tight hug to each other, and at this point, we decided to spend some. together. We went to a cafeteria to sit and had a cup of coffee together with some snacks. </p><p>Over the cups of coffee, we recalled the memories of our school days especially, the good time we had at school with our friends, playing games, making fun of our teachers, and making other mischiefs. Karan told me that how difficult it was for him to initially adjust in Canada. It took him a while but, after that, he made many friends there, and now he loves Canada. </p><p>In fact, he also suggested me to take the IELTS exam and move to Canada for my further study as Canadian Institutes are recognized all over the world for quality education. Now it was the time to say good bye but, before that, we clicked few photographs to keep the memories of this surprise meet and also shared on social media account surprise surprise our other friends as well. </p><p><strong>Conclusion: </strong><br>I also shared my personal contact with my friend so that we could remain in touch afterward as well.

Why do friends meet up?</strong><br>I think there are various reasons. The first is to just spend some time together because for most people doing things together is more fun than doing things alone. Secondly, I think it is just to talk, share, and get advice on matters and so on.</p><p><strong>2. Are there any meetings that people need to plan in advance?</strong><br>Yes, there are many meetings that people plan in advance like a doctor’s appointment. In case of friends also, it is better to take an appointment because the other person might be busy with work.</p><p><strong>3. Are there any jobs related to unexpected things?</strong><br>I think there are companies that help people plan surprise parties. So that may be a job related to unexpected things. I can’t think of anything else besides that at the moment. In research also, many findings have been unexpected – gravity, for example.</p><p><strong>4. Do unexpected things lead to progress on our society?</strong><br>Yes, for sure. Like I said before, scientific discoveries happen by chance. The biggest discovery I can think of was of the microwave. It was discovered by the scientists while working on something completely unrelated, and now we can’t imagine a kitchen without a microwave.</p><h4>Some useful vocabulary</h4><p class=\"has-text-color has-background\" style=\"background-color:#8ed1fc;color:#000\">whereabouts<br><strong>Meaning:</strong> the place where someone or something is.<br><strong>Example:</strong> He told me that he came to know my whereabouts through the photos which I had uploaded on Instagram</p>"}]}
